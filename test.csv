Came here for my little sister's early birthday lunch and as they saw my note on open table to surprise her, that's exactly what they did. I wouldn't have expected any less but I'm glad they remembered and that was a definite plus. We had the 7 course tasting menu - definite fan of the pate - so good - we cleaned the bowl on that one, the yellowtail tartare on the cracker - amazing - the rice cake one was semi ok - I think it would've been better if it was with the cracker instead of the rice cake. We moved on to our next course of the sashimi of the day as well as our various salmon bowls and the lobster and shrimp noodle soup (FYI this is no noodles in there even though the menu had said noodles - basically just lobster and shrimp flavored soup with two pieces of each - can't complain though, it was very fresh). I also very much enjoyed my last dish the premium sashimi with a supplement - well worth it - so fresh - loved that they had uni and tuna in the box - so good and paired well with their version of the miso soup. I also enjoyed the fact that they had actual Japanese sushi chefs and not what you see so often these days - Chinese who pretend to be sushi chefs?? usually at those AYCE places - no go! Not to look down upon it - but I feel like the best Japanese places need to be authentic. Very much enjoyed their passionfruit cocktail dessert as well as the teapudding - one of the must-go's on my list crossed off! :) Had an impeccable dining experience here at Brushstroke NYC. We went with the $135/pp kaiseki fixed meal and it came with 8 different courses. This time of year, they have the spring menu. Wish I could remember all of the name of the dishes but unfortunately, I don't. Either way, the food was absolutely delicious and the chef executed the meals so beautifully!My S/O and I enjoyed every plate. I suggest getting the beef sirloin, lobster miso soup, and the eel ! The service was also amazing, just what you expect in a high end restaurant. Our sommelier, Joshua C. was so knowledgable and very accommodating! He suggested the perfect wine and cocktails with our food. We really enjoyed the experience and we can't wait to go back for more! Early spring kaiseki available now ($135 pp), along w/ their a la carte menu for dinner.Highly recommend the sashimi, miyazaki wagyu (Oregon washu - non-upgrade - is just as good), eel hitsumabushi, and chirashi upgrades, if ordering the kaiseki.Excellent service.Highest recommendation.: 10 calendars We ordered the omakase menu. A-la-Carte is available as well. Food is amazing! Very creative in plate decorations and raw materials picks. More importantly, the food tastes great. They offer a long wine and sake list - you'll be able to spot something you want. Great service too. The ambience and setting is good for both small or large groups. Reservation is not hard to make and can be made via Open Table. I just can't think of any downside. Worth a second visit. My husband decided on our date day to eat at a Japanese restaurant for lunch in the SoHo area after some shopping and walking around at Rockefeller center. There was plenty of metered parking spaces nearby because most people were traveling on Christmas Eve to see their families. We however, took the train here to avoid the traffic hassle. This place had excellent service from when we walked in until we finished our lunch date. There was a limited Christmas lunch menu (3 fixed options: 4-course, 6-course and 4-course vegetarian) that we were quite disappointed about but we decided on the 4-course menu. All 4 courses had excellent flavor and they were put together in a unique fashion so you were not overly full at the end of the meal. Our 1st course was the amuse-bouche, which consists of 3 different hors d'oeuvres according to the chef's selection. Then we each received a complimentary piece of yellowtail scallion hand roll to wrap ourselves. The 2nd course was the chawanmushi, a traditional Japanese savory custard made with winter mushrooms & truffle ankake. Our 3rd and 4th courses were different because he got the stewed pork cheek and shrimp with egg over rice while I got the Norway salmon and stewed beef cheek over ankake rice. All the food tasted fantastic but it didn't fit our simple food pallet. Although, it is nice to switch things up at times so we will definitely be back again in the future for dinner when we can order off the full menu. In a city where asian food is held at a high standard, Brushtroke does an excellent job at creating a perfect experience with authentic and creative flavors as well as a cozy atmosphere.The staff if attentive and knowledgeable. I loved sitting at the bar, which was still cozy and private.The dishes were creative and the flavors carried much depth. Plating was lovely. Very good value. Each course is legit and delicious. Love that we were not too full after the whole meal like other tasting menus we had before...The first course starts very refreshing, with sashimi urchin, scallop, strawberry foaming. My favorite dish is the seafood stew soup, with lobster, cod fish, etc. It has many flavors, and super delicious! We came with a group of 6 friends, so were able to try most of the dishes! Some personal tips on the dishes:1. The shrimp over rice is more popular among us. The rice with egg yolk was super tender.2. We all like the duck breast more than the salmon. It was very tender, and the seasoning is just right. Salmon is a little bit dry and feels like miso is better cooked with Cod than salmon.3. We tried all the dessert! And here's our rating.    Creme Brulee, Hojicha-Tea Pudding, Matcha-Green Tea Ice Cream& soy sauce gelato puff, Matcha cake, beets ice cream, passion fruit sorbet.The creme brulee and Hojich-tea pudding were definitely our favorite.The soy sauce gelato was definitely very interesting, not bad at all! Not a big fan of beets, and the ice cream is indeed okay...It was my first Kaiseki experience. Definitely loved it! Only one downside is a lot of the dish were very standard, like sashimi, sushi were pretty common as many other restaurants. Guess it supposed to like that? But in general, the value of the meal was very good. Would definitely love to go back some other time! When you come to miss Japanese food in NY, this place may satisfy your desire. Amazing food! I love love love the hand rolls!We came in for a Saturday brunch. The portions were just right and you don't feel stuffed as you usually would from these omakase menus. The teas were amazing, be sure to try the hojicha. The food is very authentically Japanese.The service was incredible too. I would definitely return, want to try out their dinner menu! I feel heartbroken Michelin removed their stars, they totally deserve their stars back! Wonderful! What a treat to be able to have eaten here on my last (rainy) night in NY. Located in a tranquil neighborhood in Tribeca, this lovely kaiseki spot is busy so make rezzies. I was lucky enough to get seated at the bar to watch the chefs and his sous chefs in action the whole night.You HAVE to go with their tasting menu which is expensive at $135 pp by why else would you come here? You ain't going to order chicken teriyaki, I can tell you that. I was treated to such a lovely Japanese tour and I was beside myself with delight. I guess the chef sensed that so he put a little extra in my chirashi course and I got to sample for free a lovely after-dinner drink that the smart sommelier thought I'd enjoy. It was a all these little things all night that made this the best dinner I've had in NYC. I can't pick the best dish of the night because everything was delicious and surprisingly filling. The chef played with hot and cold, and soft and hard textures. But the loveliest presentation was the tea-lighted tray with the leaf-wrapped salmon and the snail and all these other lovely little treasures that left an amazing memory on your palate. And the staff were all super attentive and amazingly helpful. I wanted for nothing. After my dinner, the manager helped me with my coat, opened my umbrella, and walked me out the restaurant to point me to the safest route back to my hotel. I was a princess that night and I was royally smiling the short jaunt back to the W, while it drizzled softly and I took in the lights of the city. I had my birthday dinner here. What a culinary experience! We sat at the bar because I wanted to see the chefs in action. We had the Omaska tasting menu during the spring - we were ""wowed"" by each entree as the flavors are splendid. I've been to other Omaska tastings but Brushstroke was a entirely different experience because the chef explored the ingredients and it left your tastebuds happy, IMO. It was not your transitional Omaska tasting at a Japanese restaurant. Brushstroke took it up three notches and left you desiring much much more.Furthermore, the staff members were extremely attentive and quick - you will get royal treatment here. I highly recommend dining here on any occasion. It was truly an extraordinary experience. I am looking forward to coming back for lunch! Came here for my fiance birthday, we sat on the sushi bar ( used to be ichimura), and they bring the new chef Isao Yamada and his new style Kaiseki sushi. Tasting menu is $125 per person, about 10 course, dessert is not part of the tasting menu. Everything here is well present and the seafood was fresh. Watching chef prepared each dishes was an amazing experience. He answer all our questions, and was very patient and kind. Food was fabulous here, is not the traditional sushi( at least not how it present), sushi was sit on the sake cup, and combination with fish type and the sauce was also interesting. We event end up received two regular size of dessert because of my fiance birthday, that cost at least $30 per menu. Thank you chef and waiter( forgot his name). We just love the food here! My husband thinks the food is getting better and better each time as we come! We are looking forward to our next visit. Very authentic Japanese cuisine. Service is very attentive. Lunch tasting menu is way worth the price! Strongly recommend! P.S.: although I am pregnant, the lunch tasting menu has all-cooked choices for me! I also noticed that the executive chef was always in the kitchen to ensure all the food come out right, which I really appreciate.Overall, a very pleasant dining experience. Will definitely come back! I had the best tasting menu experience ever in NYC here at Brushstroke.  Just to give you context, I find most tasting menus to be too long (Eleven Madison Park killed me at over 4 hours).  Brushstroke has a $135 8 course tasting menu (Kaiseki) that changes seasonally, and we were there for just over 3 hours.  Japanese cuisine lends itself well to tasting menus because many of the foods are more clean-tasting, fresh and light... which is perfect for multiple courses. We had the Winter Kaiseki Tasting Menu.  Seven out of the eight courses were phenomenal.  I felt that each course was just the right amount of food (again, another EMP comparison is that theirs were unsatisfying bite-size courses).  Plus, everything was served in a timely manner.  A few minutes after finishing each course (time enough to talk about it and relax), the very efficient servers whisked everything away.  The courses ranged all different styles: soup, rice, sashimi, fish, etc.  The one course that fell flat was the one that just had a lot of stuff going on -- there were oysters, battered cod and oysters, salmon covered under foam(?), two slices of duck, and some kind of roll.  Visually, the oyster was off-putting given it's huge size and the pink sauce it was floating in; meanwhile, the duck seemed out of place amongst all the seafood.  The cod and the salmon was the best part of the course. By the end, we were all stuffed.  The last course is dessert, and while I always have room for dessert.... I was struggling here.  If you want to end on a refreshing, light note, go with the whatever sorbet option is on there.  We had the lime sorbet and it was delicious.My friends got the $100 wine and sake pairing and LOVED the choices made by the highly educated and clearly-passionate-about-his-job sommelier.  Next time, I'll go for that choice.I'd highly recommend this place for: People who love Japanese and are looking for something delicious that isn't sushisushisushiPeople going on dates.  That place has a very warm ambiance and isn't terribly big.Special occasions that won't break the bank Great Service, very fresh sushi / sashimi on the kaiseki menu.

We had the Omaska tasting menu during the spring - we were ""wowed"" by each entree as the flavors are splendid. I've been to other Omaska tastings but Brushstroke was a entirely different experience because the chef explored the ingredients and it left your tastebuds happy, IMO. It was not your transitional Omaska tasting at a Japanese restaurant. Brushstroke took it up three notches and left you desiring much much more.Furthermore, the staff members were extremely attentive and quick - you will get royal treatment here. I highly recommend dining here on any occasion. It was truly an extraordinary experience. I am looking forward to coming back for lunch! Came here for my fiance birthday, we sat on the sushi bar ( used to be ichimura), and they bring the new chef Isao Yamada and his new style Kaiseki sushi. Tasting menu is $125 per person, about 10 course, dessert is not part of the tasting menu. Everything here is well present and the seafood was fresh. Watching chef prepared each dishes was an amazing experience. He answer all our questions, and was very patient and kind. Food was fabulous here, is not the traditional sushi( at least not how it present), sushi was sit on the sake cup, and combination with fish type and the sauce was also interesting. We event end up received two regular size of dessert because of my fiance birthday, that cost at least $30 per menu. Thank you chef and waiter( forgot his name). We just love the food here! My husband thinks the food is getting better and better each time as we come! We are looking forward to our next visit. Very authentic Japanese cuisine. Service is very attentive. Lunch tasting menu is way worth the price! Strongly recommend! P.S.: although I am pregnant, the lunch tasting menu has all-cooked choices for me! I also noticed that the executive chef was always in the kitchen to ensure all the food come out right, which I really appreciate.Overall, a very pleasant dining experience. Will definitely come back! I had the best tasting menu experience ever in NYC here at Brushstroke.  Just to give you context, I find most tasting menus to be too long (Eleven Madison Park killed me at over 4 hours).  Brushstroke has a $135 8 course tasting menu (Kaiseki) that changes seasonally, and we were there for just over 3 hours.  Japanese cuisine lends itself well to tasting menus because many of the foods are more clean-tasting, fresh and light... which is perfect for multiple courses. We had the Winter Kaiseki Tasting Menu.  Seven out of the eight courses were phenomenal.  I felt that each course was just the right amount of food (again, another EMP comparison is that theirs were unsatisfying bite-size courses).  Plus, everything was served in a timely manner.  A few minutes after finishing each course (time enough to talk about it and relax), the very efficient servers whisked everything away.  The courses ranged all different styles: soup, rice, sashimi, fish, etc.  The one course that fell flat was the one that just had a lot of stuff going on -- there were oysters, battered cod and oysters, salmon covered under foam(?), two slices of duck, and some kind of roll.  Visually, the oyster was off-putting given it's huge size and the pink sauce it was floating in; meanwhile, the duck seemed out of place amongst all the seafood.  The cod and the salmon was the best part of the course. By the end, we were all stuffed.  The last course is dessert, and while I always have room for dessert.... I was struggling here.  If you want to end on a refreshing, light note, go with the whatever sorbet option is on there.  We had the lime sorbet and it was delicious.My friends got the $100 wine and sake pairing and LOVED the choices made by the highly educated and clearly-passionate-about-his-job sommelier.  Next time, I'll go for that choice.I'd highly recommend this place for: People who love Japanese and are looking for something delicious that isn't sushisushisushiPeople going on dates.  That place has a very warm ambiance and isn't terribly big.Special occasions that won't break the bank Great Service, very fresh sushi / sashimi on the kaiseki menu. Came here for my little sister's early birthday lunch and as they saw my note on open table to surprise her, that's exactly what they did. I wouldn't have expected any less but I'm glad they remembered and that was a definite plus. We had the 7 course tasting menu - definite fan of the pate - so good - we cleaned the bowl on that one, the yellowtail tartare on the cracker - amazing - the rice cake one was semi ok - I think it would've been better if it was with the cracker instead of the rice cake. We moved on to our next course of the sashimi of the day as well as our various salmon bowls and the lobster and shrimp noodle soup (FYI this is no noodles in there even though the menu had said noodles - basically just lobster and shrimp flavored soup with two pieces of each - can't complain though, it was very fresh). I also very much enjoyed my last dish the premium sashimi with a supplement - well worth it - so fresh - loved that they had uni and tuna in the box - so good and paired well with their version of the miso soup. I also enjoyed the fact that they had actual Japanese sushi chefs and not what you see so often these days - Chinese who pretend to be sushi chefs?? usually at those AYCE places - no go! Not to look down upon it - but I feel like the best Japanese places need to be authentic. Very much enjoyed their passionfruit cocktail dessert as well as the teapudding - one of the must-go's on my list crossed off! :) Had an impeccable dining experience here at Brushstroke NYC. We went with the $135/pp kaiseki fixed meal and it came with 8 different courses. This time of year, they have the spring menu. Wish I could remember all of the name of the dishes but unfortunately, I don't. Either way, the food was absolutely delicious and the chef executed the meals so beautifully!My S/O and I enjoyed every plate. I suggest getting the beef sirloin, lobster miso soup, and the eel ! The service was also amazing, just what you expect in a high end restaurant. Our sommelier, Joshua C. was so knowledgable and very accommodating! He suggested the perfect wine and cocktails with our food. We really enjoyed the experience and we can't wait to go back for more! Early spring kaiseki available now ($135 pp), along w/ their a la carte menu for dinner.Highly recommend the sashimi, miyazaki wagyu (Oregon washu - non-upgrade - is just as good), eel hitsumabushi, and chirashi upgrades, if ordering the kaiseki.Excellent service.Highest recommendation.: 10 calendars We ordered the omakase menu. A-la-Carte is available as well. Food is amazing! Very creative in plate decorations and raw materials picks. More importantly, the food tastes great. They offer a long wine and sake list - you'll be able to spot something you want. Great service too. The ambience and setting is good for both small or large groups. Reservation is not hard to make and can be made via Open Table. I just can't think of any downside. Worth a second visit. My husband decided on our date day to eat at a Japanese restaurant for lunch in the SoHo area after some shopping and walking around at Rockefeller center. There was plenty of metered parking spaces nearby because most people were traveling on Christmas Eve to see their families. We however, took the train here to avoid the traffic hassle. This place had excellent service from when we walked in until we finished our lunch date. There was a limited Christmas lunch menu (3 fixed options: 4-course, 6-course and 4-course vegetarian) that we were quite disappointed about but we decided on the 4-course menu. All 4 courses had excellent flavor and they were put together in a unique fashion so you were not overly full at the end of the meal. Our 1st course was the amuse-bouche, which consists of 3 different hors d'oeuvres according to the chef's selection. Then we each received a complimentary piece of yellowtail scallion hand roll to wrap ourselves. The 2nd course was the chawanmushi, a traditional Japanese savory custard made with winter mushrooms & truffle ankake. Our 3rd and 4th courses were different because he got the stewed pork cheek and shrimp with egg over rice while I got the Norway salmon and stewed beef cheek over ankake rice. All the food tasted fantastic but it didn't fit our simple food pallet. Although, it is nice to switch things up at times so we will definitely be back again in the future for dinner when we can order off the full menu. In a city where asian food is held at a high standard, Brushtroke does an excellent job at creating a perfect experience with authentic and creative flavors as well as a cozy atmosphere.The staff if attentive and knowledgeable. I loved sitting at the bar, which was still cozy and private.The dishes were creative and the flavors carried much depth. Plating was lovely. Very good value. Each course is legit and delicious. Love that we were not too full after the whole meal like other tasting menus we had before...The first course starts very refreshing, with sashimi urchin, scallop, strawberry foaming. My favorite dish is the seafood stew soup, with lobster, cod fish, etc. It has many flavors, and super delicious! We came with a group of 6 friends, so were able to try most of the dishes! Some personal tips on the dishes:1. The shrimp over rice is more popular among us. The rice with egg yolk was super tender.2. We all like the duck breast more than the salmon. It was very tender, and the seasoning is just right. Salmon is a little bit dry and feels like miso is better cooked with Cod than salmon.3. We tried all the dessert! And here's our rating.    Creme Brulee, Hojicha-Tea Pudding, Matcha-Green Tea Ice Cream& soy sauce gelato puff, Matcha cake, beets ice cream, passion fruit sorbet.The creme brulee and Hojich-tea pudding were definitely our favorite.The soy sauce gelato was definitely very interesting, not bad at all! Not a big fan of beets, and the ice cream is indeed okay...It was my first Kaiseki experience. Definitely loved it! Only one downside is a lot of the dish were very standard, like sashimi, sushi were pretty common as many other restaurants. Guess it supposed to like that? But in general, the value of the meal was very good. Would definitely love to go back some other time! When you come to miss Japanese food in NY, this place may satisfy your desire. Amazing food! I love love love the hand rolls!We came in for a Saturday brunch. The portions were just right and you don't feel stuffed as you usually would from these omakase menus. The teas were amazing, be sure to try the hojicha. The food is very authentically Japanese.The service was incredible too. I would definitely return, want to try out their dinner menu! I feel heartbroken Michelin removed their stars, they totally deserve their stars back! Wonderful! What a treat to be able to have eaten here on my last (rainy) night in NY. Located in a tranquil neighborhood in Tribeca, this lovely kaiseki spot is busy so make rezzies. I was lucky enough to get seated at the bar to watch the chefs and his sous chefs in action the whole night.You HAVE to go with their tasting menu which is expensive at $135 pp by why else would you come here? You ain't going to order chicken teriyaki, I can tell you that. I was treated to such a lovely Japanese tour and I was beside myself with delight. I guess the chef sensed that so he put a little extra in my chirashi course and I got to sample for free a lovely after-dinner drink that the smart sommelier thought I'd enjoy. It was a all these little things all night that made this the best dinner I've had in NYC. I can't pick the best dish of the night because everything was delicious and surprisingly filling. The chef played with hot and cold, and soft and hard textures. But the loveliest presentation was the tea-lighted tray with the leaf-wrapped salmon and the snail and all these other lovely little treasures that left an amazing memory on your palate. And the staff were all super attentive and amazingly helpful. I wanted for nothing. After my dinner, the manager helped me with my coat, opened my umbrella, and walked me out the restaurant to point me to the safest route back to my hotel.

My favorite dish is the seafood stew soup, with lobster, cod fish, etc. It has many flavors, and super delicious! We came with a group of 6 friends, so were able to try most of the dishes! Some personal tips on the dishes:1. The shrimp over rice is more popular among us. The rice with egg yolk was super tender.2. We all like the duck breast more than the salmon. It was very tender, and the seasoning is just right. Salmon is a little bit dry and feels like miso is better cooked with Cod than salmon.3. We tried all the dessert! And here's our rating.    Creme Brulee, Hojicha-Tea Pudding, Matcha-Green Tea Ice Cream& soy sauce gelato puff, Matcha cake, beets ice cream, passion fruit sorbet.The creme brulee and Hojich-tea pudding were definitely our favorite.The soy sauce gelato was definitely very interesting, not bad at all! Not a big fan of beets, and the ice cream is indeed okay...It was my first Kaiseki experience. Definitely loved it! Only one downside is a lot of the dish were very standard, like sashimi, sushi were pretty common as many other restaurants. Guess it supposed to like that? But in general, the value of the meal was very good. Would definitely love to go back some other time! When you come to miss Japanese food in NY, this place may satisfy your desire. Amazing food! I love love love the hand rolls!We came in for a Saturday brunch. The portions were just right and you don't feel stuffed as you usually would from these omakase menus. The teas were amazing, be sure to try the hojicha. The food is very authentically Japanese.The service was incredible too. I would definitely return, want to try out their dinner menu! I feel heartbroken Michelin removed their stars, they totally deserve their stars back! Wonderful! What a treat to be able to have eaten here on my last (rainy) night in NY. Located in a tranquil neighborhood in Tribeca, this lovely kaiseki spot is busy so make rezzies. I was lucky enough to get seated at the bar to watch the chefs and his sous chefs in action the whole night.You HAVE to go with their tasting menu which is expensive at $135 pp by why else would you come here? You ain't going to order chicken teriyaki, I can tell you that. I was treated to such a lovely Japanese tour and I was beside myself with delight. I guess the chef sensed that so he put a little extra in my chirashi course and I got to sample for free a lovely after-dinner drink that the smart sommelier thought I'd enjoy. It was a all these little things all night that made this the best dinner I've had in NYC. I can't pick the best dish of the night because everything was delicious and surprisingly filling. The chef played with hot and cold, and soft and hard textures. But the loveliest presentation was the tea-lighted tray with the leaf-wrapped salmon and the snail and all these other lovely little treasures that left an amazing memory on your palate. And the staff were all super attentive and amazingly helpful. I wanted for nothing. After my dinner, the manager helped me with my coat, opened my umbrella, and walked me out the restaurant to point me to the safest route back to my hotel. I was a princess that night and I was royally smiling the short jaunt back to the W, while it drizzled softly and I took in the lights of the city. I had my birthday dinner here. What a culinary experience! We sat at the bar because I wanted to see the chefs in action. We had the Omaska tasting menu during the spring - we were ""wowed"" by each entree as the flavors are splendid. I've been to other Omaska tastings but Brushstroke was a entirely different experience because the chef explored the ingredients and it left your tastebuds happy, IMO. It was not your transitional Omaska tasting at a Japanese restaurant. Brushstroke took it up three notches and left you desiring much much more.Furthermore, the staff members were extremely attentive and quick - you will get royal treatment here. I highly recommend dining here on any occasion. It was truly an extraordinary experience. I am looking forward to coming back for lunch! Came here for my fiance birthday, we sat on the sushi bar ( used to be ichimura), and they bring the new chef Isao Yamada and his new style Kaiseki sushi. Tasting menu is $125 per person, about 10 course, dessert is not part of the tasting menu. Everything here is well present and the seafood was fresh. Watching chef prepared each dishes was an amazing experience. He answer all our questions, and was very patient and kind. Food was fabulous here, is not the traditional sushi( at least not how it present), sushi was sit on the sake cup, and combination with fish type and the sauce was also interesting. We event end up received two regular size of dessert because of my fiance birthday, that cost at least $30 per menu. Thank you chef and waiter( forgot his name). We just love the food here! My husband thinks the food is getting better and better each time as we come! We are looking forward to our next visit. Very authentic Japanese cuisine. Service is very attentive. Lunch tasting menu is way worth the price! Strongly recommend! P.S.: although I am pregnant, the lunch tasting menu has all-cooked choices for me! I also noticed that the executive chef was always in the kitchen to ensure all the food come out right, which I really appreciate.Overall, a very pleasant dining experience. Will definitely come back! I had the best tasting menu experience ever in NYC here at Brushstroke.  Just to give you context, I find most tasting menus to be too long (Eleven Madison Park killed me at over 4 hours).  Brushstroke has a $135 8 course tasting menu (Kaiseki) that changes seasonally, and we were there for just over 3 hours.  Japanese cuisine lends itself well to tasting menus because many of the foods are more clean-tasting, fresh and light... which is perfect for multiple courses. We had the Winter Kaiseki Tasting Menu.  Seven out of the eight courses were phenomenal.  I felt that each course was just the right amount of food (again, another EMP comparison is that theirs were unsatisfying bite-size courses).  Plus, everything was served in a timely manner.  A few minutes after finishing each course (time enough to talk about it and relax), the very efficient servers whisked everything away.  The courses ranged all different styles: soup, rice, sashimi, fish, etc.  The one course that fell flat was the one that just had a lot of stuff going on -- there were oysters, battered cod and oysters, salmon covered under foam(?), two slices of duck, and some kind of roll.  Visually, the oyster was off-putting given it's huge size and the pink sauce it was floating in; meanwhile, the duck seemed out of place amongst all the seafood.  The cod and the salmon was the best part of the course. By the end, we were all stuffed.  The last course is dessert, and while I always have room for dessert.... I was struggling here.  If you want to end on a refreshing, light note, go with the whatever sorbet option is on there.  We had the lime sorbet and it was delicious.My friends got the $100 wine and sake pairing and LOVED the choices made by the highly educated and clearly-passionate-about-his-job sommelier.  Next time, I'll go for that choice.I'd highly recommend this place for: People who love Japanese and are looking for something delicious that isn't sushisushisushiPeople going on dates.  That place has a very warm ambiance and isn't terribly big.Special occasions that won't break the bank Great Service, very fresh sushi / sashimi on the kaiseki menu. Came here for my little sister's early birthday lunch and as they saw my note on open table to surprise her, that's exactly what they did. I wouldn't have expected any less but I'm glad they remembered and that was a definite plus. We had the 7 course tasting menu - definite fan of the pate - so good - we cleaned the bowl on that one, the yellowtail tartare on the cracker - amazing - the rice cake one was semi ok - I think it would've been better if it was with the cracker instead of the rice cake. We moved on to our next course of the sashimi of the day as well as our various salmon bowls and the lobster and shrimp noodle soup (FYI this is no noodles in there even though the menu had said noodles - basically just lobster and shrimp flavored soup with two pieces of each - can't complain though, it was very fresh). I also very much enjoyed my last dish the premium sashimi with a supplement - well worth it - so fresh - loved that they had uni and tuna in the box - so good and paired well with their version of the miso soup. I also enjoyed the fact that they had actual Japanese sushi chefs and not what you see so often these days - Chinese who pretend to be sushi chefs?? usually at those AYCE places - no go! Not to look down upon it - but I feel like the best Japanese places need to be authentic. Very much enjoyed their passionfruit cocktail dessert as well as the teapudding - one of the must-go's on my list crossed off! :) Had an impeccable dining experience here at Brushstroke NYC. We went with the $135/pp kaiseki fixed meal and it came with 8 different courses. This time of year, they have the spring menu. Wish I could remember all of the name of the dishes but unfortunately, I don't. Either way, the food was absolutely delicious and the chef executed the meals so beautifully!My S/O and I enjoyed every plate. I suggest getting the beef sirloin, lobster miso soup, and the eel ! The service was also amazing, just what you expect in a high end restaurant. Our sommelier, Joshua C. was so knowledgable and very accommodating! He suggested the perfect wine and cocktails with our food. We really enjoyed the experience and we can't wait to go back for more! Early spring kaiseki available now ($135 pp), along w/ their a la carte menu for dinner.Highly recommend the sashimi, miyazaki wagyu (Oregon washu - non-upgrade - is just as good), eel hitsumabushi, and chirashi upgrades, if ordering the kaiseki.Excellent service.Highest recommendation.: 10 calendars We ordered the omakase menu. A-la-Carte is available as well. Food is amazing! Very creative in plate decorations and raw materials picks. More importantly, the food tastes great. They offer a long wine and sake list - you'll be able to spot something you want. Great service too. The ambience and setting is good for both small or large groups. Reservation is not hard to make and can be made via Open Table. I just can't think of any downside. Worth a second visit. My husband decided on our date day to eat at a Japanese restaurant for lunch in the SoHo area after some shopping and walking around at Rockefeller center. There was plenty of metered parking spaces nearby because most people were traveling on Christmas Eve to see their families. We however, took the train here to avoid the traffic hassle. This place had excellent service from when we walked in until we finished our lunch date. There was a limited Christmas lunch menu (3 fixed options: 4-course, 6-course and 4-course vegetarian) that we were quite disappointed about but we decided on the 4-course menu. All 4 courses had excellent flavor and they were put together in a unique fashion so you were not overly full at the end of the meal. Our 1st course was the amuse-bouche, which consists of 3 different hors d'oeuvres according to the chef's selection. Then we each received a complimentary piece of yellowtail scallion hand roll to wrap ourselves. The 2nd course was the chawanmushi, a traditional Japanese savory custard made with winter mushrooms & truffle ankake. Our 3rd and 4th courses were different because he got the stewed pork cheek and shrimp with egg over rice while I got the Norway salmon and stewed beef cheek over ankake rice. All the food tasted fantastic but it didn't fit our simple food pallet. Although, it is nice to switch things up at times so we will definitely be back again in the future for dinner when we can order off the full menu. In a city where asian food is held at a high standard, Brushtroke does an excellent job at creating a perfect experience with authentic and creative flavors as well as a cozy atmosphere.The staff if attentive and knowledgeable.

Wish I could remember all of the name of the dishes but unfortunately, I don't. Either way, the food was absolutely delicious and the chef executed the meals so beautifully!My S/O and I enjoyed every plate. I suggest getting the beef sirloin, lobster miso soup, and the eel ! The service was also amazing, just what you expect in a high end restaurant. Our sommelier, Joshua C. was so knowledgable and very accommodating! He suggested the perfect wine and cocktails with our food. We really enjoyed the experience and we can't wait to go back for more! Early spring kaiseki available now ($135 pp), along w/ their a la carte menu for dinner.Highly recommend the sashimi, miyazaki wagyu (Oregon washu - non-upgrade - is just as good), eel hitsumabushi, and chirashi upgrades, if ordering the kaiseki.Excellent service.Highest recommendation.: 10 calendars We ordered the omakase menu. A-la-Carte is available as well. Food is amazing! Very creative in plate decorations and raw materials picks. More importantly, the food tastes great. They offer a long wine and sake list - you'll be able to spot something you want. Great service too. The ambience and setting is good for both small or large groups. Reservation is not hard to make and can be made via Open Table. I just can't think of any downside. Worth a second visit. My husband decided on our date day to eat at a Japanese restaurant for lunch in the SoHo area after some shopping and walking around at Rockefeller center. There was plenty of metered parking spaces nearby because most people were traveling on Christmas Eve to see their families. We however, took the train here to avoid the traffic hassle. This place had excellent service from when we walked in until we finished our lunch date. There was a limited Christmas lunch menu (3 fixed options: 4-course, 6-course and 4-course vegetarian) that we were quite disappointed about but we decided on the 4-course menu. All 4 courses had excellent flavor and they were put together in a unique fashion so you were not overly full at the end of the meal. Our 1st course was the amuse-bouche, which consists of 3 different hors d'oeuvres according to the chef's selection. Then we each received a complimentary piece of yellowtail scallion hand roll to wrap ourselves. The 2nd course was the chawanmushi, a traditional Japanese savory custard made with winter mushrooms & truffle ankake. Our 3rd and 4th courses were different because he got the stewed pork cheek and shrimp with egg over rice while I got the Norway salmon and stewed beef cheek over ankake rice. All the food tasted fantastic but it didn't fit our simple food pallet. Although, it is nice to switch things up at times so we will definitely be back again in the future for dinner when we can order off the full menu. In a city where asian food is held at a high standard, Brushtroke does an excellent job at creating a perfect experience with authentic and creative flavors as well as a cozy atmosphere.The staff if attentive and knowledgeable. I loved sitting at the bar, which was still cozy and private.The dishes were creative and the flavors carried much depth. Plating was lovely. Very good value. Each course is legit and delicious. Love that we were not too full after the whole meal like other tasting menus we had before...The first course starts very refreshing, with sashimi urchin, scallop, strawberry foaming. My favorite dish is the seafood stew soup, with lobster, cod fish, etc. It has many flavors, and super delicious! We came with a group of 6 friends, so were able to try most of the dishes! Some personal tips on the dishes:1. The shrimp over rice is more popular among us. The rice with egg yolk was super tender.2. We all like the duck breast more than the salmon. It was very tender, and the seasoning is just right. Salmon is a little bit dry and feels like miso is better cooked with Cod than salmon.3. We tried all the dessert! And here's our rating.    Creme Brulee, Hojicha-Tea Pudding, Matcha-Green Tea Ice Cream& soy sauce gelato puff, Matcha cake, beets ice cream, passion fruit sorbet.The creme brulee and Hojich-tea pudding were definitely our favorite.The soy sauce gelato was definitely very interesting, not bad at all! Not a big fan of beets, and the ice cream is indeed okay...It was my first Kaiseki experience. Definitely loved it! Only one downside is a lot of the dish were very standard, like sashimi, sushi were pretty common as many other restaurants. Guess it supposed to like that? But in general, the value of the meal was very good. Would definitely love to go back some other time! When you come to miss Japanese food in NY, this place may satisfy your desire. Amazing food! I love love love the hand rolls!We came in for a Saturday brunch. The portions were just right and you don't feel stuffed as you usually would from these omakase menus. The teas were amazing, be sure to try the hojicha. The food is very authentically Japanese.The service was incredible too. I would definitely return, want to try out their dinner menu! I feel heartbroken Michelin removed their stars, they totally deserve their stars back! Wonderful! What a treat to be able to have eaten here on my last (rainy) night in NY. Located in a tranquil neighborhood in Tribeca, this lovely kaiseki spot is busy so make rezzies. I was lucky enough to get seated at the bar to watch the chefs and his sous chefs in action the whole night.You HAVE to go with their tasting menu which is expensive at $135 pp by why else would you come here? You ain't going to order chicken teriyaki, I can tell you that. I was treated to such a lovely Japanese tour and I was beside myself with delight. I guess the chef sensed that so he put a little extra in my chirashi course and I got to sample for free a lovely after-dinner drink that the smart sommelier thought I'd enjoy. It was a all these little things all night that made this the best dinner I've had in NYC. I can't pick the best dish of the night because everything was delicious and surprisingly filling. The chef played with hot and cold, and soft and hard textures. But the loveliest presentation was the tea-lighted tray with the leaf-wrapped salmon and the snail and all these other lovely little treasures that left an amazing memory on your palate. And the staff were all super attentive and amazingly helpful. I wanted for nothing. After my dinner, the manager helped me with my coat, opened my umbrella, and walked me out the restaurant to point me to the safest route back to my hotel. I was a princess that night and I was royally smiling the short jaunt back to the W, while it drizzled softly and I took in the lights of the city. I had my birthday dinner here. What a culinary experience! We sat at the bar because I wanted to see the chefs in action. We had the Omaska tasting menu during the spring - we were ""wowed"" by each entree as the flavors are splendid. I've been to other Omaska tastings but Brushstroke was a entirely different experience because the chef explored the ingredients and it left your tastebuds happy, IMO. It was not your transitional Omaska tasting at a Japanese restaurant. Brushstroke took it up three notches and left you desiring much much more.Furthermore, the staff members were extremely attentive and quick - you will get royal treatment here. I highly recommend dining here on any occasion. It was truly an extraordinary experience. I am looking forward to coming back for lunch! Came here for my fiance birthday, we sat on the sushi bar ( used to be ichimura), and they bring the new chef Isao Yamada and his new style Kaiseki sushi. Tasting menu is $125 per person, about 10 course, dessert is not part of the tasting menu. Everything here is well present and the seafood was fresh. Watching chef prepared each dishes was an amazing experience. He answer all our questions, and was very patient and kind. Food was fabulous here, is not the traditional sushi( at least not how it present), sushi was sit on the sake cup, and combination with fish type and the sauce was also interesting. We event end up received two regular size of dessert because of my fiance birthday, that cost at least $30 per menu. Thank you chef and waiter( forgot his name). We just love the food here! My husband thinks the food is getting better and better each time as we come! We are looking forward to our next visit. Very authentic Japanese cuisine. Service is very attentive. Lunch tasting menu is way worth the price! Strongly recommend! P.S.: although I am pregnant, the lunch tasting menu has all-cooked choices for me! I also noticed that the executive chef was always in the kitchen to ensure all the food come out right, which I really appreciate.Overall, a very pleasant dining experience. Will definitely come back! I had the best tasting menu experience ever in NYC here at Brushstroke.  Just to give you context, I find most tasting menus to be too long (Eleven Madison Park killed me at over 4 hours).  Brushstroke has a $135 8 course tasting menu (Kaiseki) that changes seasonally, and we were there for just over 3 hours.  Japanese cuisine lends itself well to tasting menus because many of the foods are more clean-tasting, fresh and light... which is perfect for multiple courses. We had the Winter Kaiseki Tasting Menu.  Seven out of the eight courses were phenomenal.  I felt that each course was just the right amount of food (again, another EMP comparison is that theirs were unsatisfying bite-size courses).  Plus, everything was served in a timely manner.  A few minutes after finishing each course (time enough to talk about it and relax), the very efficient servers whisked everything away.  The courses ranged all different styles: soup, rice, sashimi, fish, etc.  The one course that fell flat was the one that just had a lot of stuff going on -- there were oysters, battered cod and oysters, salmon covered under foam(?), two slices of duck, and some kind of roll.  Visually, the oyster was off-putting given it's huge size and the pink sauce it was floating in; meanwhile, the duck seemed out of place amongst all the seafood.  The cod and the salmon was the best part of the course. By the end, we were all stuffed.  The last course is dessert, and while I always have room for dessert.... I was struggling here.  If you want to end on a refreshing, light note, go with the whatever sorbet option is on there.  We had the lime sorbet and it was delicious.My friends got the $100 wine and sake pairing and LOVED the choices made by the highly educated and clearly-passionate-about-his-job sommelier.  Next time, I'll go for that choice.I'd highly recommend this place for: People who love Japanese and are looking for something delicious that isn't sushisushisushiPeople going on dates.  That place has a very warm ambiance and isn't terribly big.Special occasions that won't break the bank Great Service, very fresh sushi / sashimi on the kaiseki menu. Came here for my little sister's early birthday lunch and as they saw my note on open table to surprise her, that's exactly what they did. I wouldn't have expected any less but I'm glad they remembered and that was a definite plus. We had the 7 course tasting menu - definite fan of the pate - so good - we cleaned the bowl on that one, the yellowtail tartare on the cracker - amazing - the rice cake one was semi ok - I think it would've been better if it was with the cracker instead of the rice cake. We moved on to our next course of the sashimi of the day as well as our various salmon bowls and the lobster and shrimp noodle soup (FYI this is no noodles in there even though the menu had said noodles - basically just lobster and shrimp flavored soup with two pieces of each - can't complain though, it was very fresh). I also very much enjoyed my last dish the premium sashimi with a supplement - well worth it - so fresh - loved that they had uni and tuna in the box - so good and paired well with their version of the miso soup. I also enjoyed the fact that they had actual Japanese sushi chefs and not what you see so often these days - Chinese who pretend to be sushi chefs?? usually at those AYCE places - no go! Not to look down upon it - but I feel like the best Japanese places need to be authentic. Very much enjoyed their passionfruit cocktail dessert as well as the teapudding - one of the must-go's on my list crossed off! :) Had an impeccable dining experience here at Brushstroke NYC.

We had the Winter Kaiseki Tasting Menu.  Seven out of the eight courses were phenomenal.  I felt that each course was just the right amount of food (again, another EMP comparison is that theirs were unsatisfying bite-size courses).  Plus, everything was served in a timely manner.  A few minutes after finishing each course (time enough to talk about it and relax), the very efficient servers whisked everything away.  The courses ranged all different styles: soup, rice, sashimi, fish, etc.  The one course that fell flat was the one that just had a lot of stuff going on -- there were oysters, battered cod and oysters, salmon covered under foam(?), two slices of duck, and some kind of roll.  Visually, the oyster was off-putting given it's huge size and the pink sauce it was floating in; meanwhile, the duck seemed out of place amongst all the seafood.  The cod and the salmon was the best part of the course. By the end, we were all stuffed.  The last course is dessert, and while I always have room for dessert.... I was struggling here.  If you want to end on a refreshing, light note, go with the whatever sorbet option is on there.  We had the lime sorbet and it was delicious.My friends got the $100 wine and sake pairing and LOVED the choices made by the highly educated and clearly-passionate-about-his-job sommelier.  Next time, I'll go for that choice.I'd highly recommend this place for: People who love Japanese and are looking for something delicious that isn't sushisushisushiPeople going on dates.  That place has a very warm ambiance and isn't terribly big.Special occasions that won't break the bank Great Service, very fresh sushi / sashimi on the kaiseki menu. Came here for my little sister's early birthday lunch and as they saw my note on open table to surprise her, that's exactly what they did. I wouldn't have expected any less but I'm glad they remembered and that was a definite plus. We had the 7 course tasting menu - definite fan of the pate - so good - we cleaned the bowl on that one, the yellowtail tartare on the cracker - amazing - the rice cake one was semi ok - I think it would've been better if it was with the cracker instead of the rice cake. We moved on to our next course of the sashimi of the day as well as our various salmon bowls and the lobster and shrimp noodle soup (FYI this is no noodles in there even though the menu had said noodles - basically just lobster and shrimp flavored soup with two pieces of each - can't complain though, it was very fresh). I also very much enjoyed my last dish the premium sashimi with a supplement - well worth it - so fresh - loved that they had uni and tuna in the box - so good and paired well with their version of the miso soup. I also enjoyed the fact that they had actual Japanese sushi chefs and not what you see so often these days - Chinese who pretend to be sushi chefs?? usually at those AYCE places - no go! Not to look down upon it - but I feel like the best Japanese places need to be authentic. Very much enjoyed their passionfruit cocktail dessert as well as the teapudding - one of the must-go's on my list crossed off! :) Had an impeccable dining experience here at Brushstroke NYC. We went with the $135/pp kaiseki fixed meal and it came with 8 different courses. This time of year, they have the spring menu. Wish I could remember all of the name of the dishes but unfortunately, I don't. Either way, the food was absolutely delicious and the chef executed the meals so beautifully!My S/O and I enjoyed every plate. I suggest getting the beef sirloin, lobster miso soup, and the eel ! The service was also amazing, just what you expect in a high end restaurant. Our sommelier, Joshua C. was so knowledgable and very accommodating! He suggested the perfect wine and cocktails with our food. We really enjoyed the experience and we can't wait to go back for more! Early spring kaiseki available now ($135 pp), along w/ their a la carte menu for dinner.Highly recommend the sashimi, miyazaki wagyu (Oregon washu - non-upgrade - is just as good), eel hitsumabushi, and chirashi upgrades, if ordering the kaiseki.Excellent service.Highest recommendation.: 10 calendars We ordered the omakase menu. A-la-Carte is available as well. Food is amazing! Very creative in plate decorations and raw materials picks. More importantly, the food tastes great. They offer a long wine and sake list - you'll be able to spot something you want. Great service too. The ambience and setting is good for both small or large groups. Reservation is not hard to make and can be made via Open Table. I just can't think of any downside. Worth a second visit. My husband decided on our date day to eat at a Japanese restaurant for lunch in the SoHo area after some shopping and walking around at Rockefeller center. There was plenty of metered parking spaces nearby because most people were traveling on Christmas Eve to see their families. We however, took the train here to avoid the traffic hassle. This place had excellent service from when we walked in until we finished our lunch date. There was a limited Christmas lunch menu (3 fixed options: 4-course, 6-course and 4-course vegetarian) that we were quite disappointed about but we decided on the 4-course menu. All 4 courses had excellent flavor and they were put together in a unique fashion so you were not overly full at the end of the meal. Our 1st course was the amuse-bouche, which consists of 3 different hors d'oeuvres according to the chef's selection. Then we each received a complimentary piece of yellowtail scallion hand roll to wrap ourselves. The 2nd course was the chawanmushi, a traditional Japanese savory custard made with winter mushrooms & truffle ankake. Our 3rd and 4th courses were different because he got the stewed pork cheek and shrimp with egg over rice while I got the Norway salmon and stewed beef cheek over ankake rice. All the food tasted fantastic but it didn't fit our simple food pallet. Although, it is nice to switch things up at times so we will definitely be back again in the future for dinner when we can order off the full menu. In a city where asian food is held at a high standard, Brushtroke does an excellent job at creating a perfect experience with authentic and creative flavors as well as a cozy atmosphere.The staff if attentive and knowledgeable. I loved sitting at the bar, which was still cozy and private.The dishes were creative and the flavors carried much depth. Plating was lovely. Very good value. Each course is legit and delicious. Love that we were not too full after the whole meal like other tasting menus we had before...The first course starts very refreshing, with sashimi urchin, scallop, strawberry foaming. My favorite dish is the seafood stew soup, with lobster, cod fish, etc. It has many flavors, and super delicious! We came with a group of 6 friends, so were able to try most of the dishes! Some personal tips on the dishes:1. The shrimp over rice is more popular among us. The rice with egg yolk was super tender.2. We all like the duck breast more than the salmon. It was very tender, and the seasoning is just right. Salmon is a little bit dry and feels like miso is better cooked with Cod than salmon.3. We tried all the dessert! And here's our rating.    Creme Brulee, Hojicha-Tea Pudding, Matcha-Green Tea Ice Cream& soy sauce gelato puff, Matcha cake, beets ice cream, passion fruit sorbet.The creme brulee and Hojich-tea pudding were definitely our favorite.The soy sauce gelato was definitely very interesting, not bad at all! Not a big fan of beets, and the ice cream is indeed okay...It was my first Kaiseki experience. Definitely loved it! Only one downside is a lot of the dish were very standard, like sashimi, sushi were pretty common as many other restaurants. Guess it supposed to like that? But in general, the value of the meal was very good. Would definitely love to go back some other time! When you come to miss Japanese food in NY, this place may satisfy your desire. Amazing food! I love love love the hand rolls!We came in for a Saturday brunch. The portions were just right and you don't feel stuffed as you usually would from these omakase menus. The teas were amazing, be sure to try the hojicha. The food is very authentically Japanese.The service was incredible too. I would definitely return, want to try out their dinner menu! I feel heartbroken Michelin removed their stars, they totally deserve their stars back! Wonderful! What a treat to be able to have eaten here on my last (rainy) night in NY. Located in a tranquil neighborhood in Tribeca, this lovely kaiseki spot is busy so make rezzies. I was lucky enough to get seated at the bar to watch the chefs and his sous chefs in action the whole night.You HAVE to go with their tasting menu which is expensive at $135 pp by why else would you come here? You ain't going to order chicken teriyaki, I can tell you that. I was treated to such a lovely Japanese tour and I was beside myself with delight. I guess the chef sensed that so he put a little extra in my chirashi course and I got to sample for free a lovely after-dinner drink that the smart sommelier thought I'd enjoy. It was a all these little things all night that made this the best dinner I've had in NYC. I can't pick the best dish of the night because everything was delicious and surprisingly filling. The chef played with hot and cold, and soft and hard textures. But the loveliest presentation was the tea-lighted tray with the leaf-wrapped salmon and the snail and all these other lovely little treasures that left an amazing memory on your palate. And the staff were all super attentive and amazingly helpful. I wanted for nothing. After my dinner, the manager helped me with my coat, opened my umbrella, and walked me out the restaurant to point me to the safest route back to my hotel. I was a princess that night and I was royally smiling the short jaunt back to the W, while it drizzled softly and I took in the lights of the city. I had my birthday dinner here. What a culinary experience! We sat at the bar because I wanted to see the chefs in action. We had the Omaska tasting menu during the spring - we were ""wowed"" by each entree as the flavors are splendid. I've been to other Omaska tastings but Brushstroke was a entirely different experience because the chef explored the ingredients and it left your tastebuds happy, IMO. It was not your transitional Omaska tasting at a Japanese restaurant. Brushstroke took it up three notches and left you desiring much much more.Furthermore, the staff members were extremely attentive and quick - you will get royal treatment here. I highly recommend dining here on any occasion. It was truly an extraordinary experience. I am looking forward to coming back for lunch! Came here for my fiance birthday, we sat on the sushi bar ( used to be ichimura), and they bring the new chef Isao Yamada and his new style Kaiseki sushi. Tasting menu is $125 per person, about 10 course, dessert is not part of the tasting menu. Everything here is well present and the seafood was fresh. Watching chef prepared each dishes was an amazing experience. He answer all our questions, and was very patient and kind. Food was fabulous here, is not the traditional sushi( at least not how it present), sushi was sit on the sake cup, and combination with fish type and the sauce was also interesting. We event end up received two regular size of dessert because of my fiance birthday, that cost at least $30 per menu. Thank you chef and waiter( forgot his name). We just love the food here! My husband thinks the food is getting better and better each time as we come! We are looking forward to our next visit. Very authentic Japanese cuisine. Service is very attentive. Lunch tasting menu is way worth the price! Strongly recommend! P.S.: although I am pregnant, the lunch tasting menu has all-cooked choices for me! I also noticed that the executive chef was always in the kitchen to ensure all the food come out right, which I really appreciate.Overall, a very pleasant dining experience. Will definitely come back! I had the best tasting menu experience ever in NYC here at Brushstroke.  Just to give you context, I find most tasting menus to be too long (Eleven Madison Park killed me at over 4 hours).

It was a all these little things all night that made this the best dinner I've had in NYC. I can't pick the best dish of the night because everything was delicious and surprisingly filling. The chef played with hot and cold, and soft and hard textures. But the loveliest presentation was the tea-lighted tray with the leaf-wrapped salmon and the snail and all these other lovely little treasures that left an amazing memory on your palate. And the staff were all super attentive and amazingly helpful. I wanted for nothing. After my dinner, the manager helped me with my coat, opened my umbrella, and walked me out the restaurant to point me to the safest route back to my hotel. I was a princess that night and I was royally smiling the short jaunt back to the W, while it drizzled softly and I took in the lights of the city. I had my birthday dinner here. What a culinary experience! We sat at the bar because I wanted to see the chefs in action. We had the Omaska tasting menu during the spring - we were ""wowed"" by each entree as the flavors are splendid. I've been to other Omaska tastings but Brushstroke was a entirely different experience because the chef explored the ingredients and it left your tastebuds happy, IMO. It was not your transitional Omaska tasting at a Japanese restaurant. Brushstroke took it up three notches and left you desiring much much more.Furthermore, the staff members were extremely attentive and quick - you will get royal treatment here. I highly recommend dining here on any occasion. It was truly an extraordinary experience. I am looking forward to coming back for lunch! Came here for my fiance birthday, we sat on the sushi bar ( used to be ichimura), and they bring the new chef Isao Yamada and his new style Kaiseki sushi. Tasting menu is $125 per person, about 10 course, dessert is not part of the tasting menu. Everything here is well present and the seafood was fresh. Watching chef prepared each dishes was an amazing experience. He answer all our questions, and was very patient and kind. Food was fabulous here, is not the traditional sushi( at least not how it present), sushi was sit on the sake cup, and combination with fish type and the sauce was also interesting. We event end up received two regular size of dessert because of my fiance birthday, that cost at least $30 per menu. Thank you chef and waiter( forgot his name). We just love the food here! My husband thinks the food is getting better and better each time as we come! We are looking forward to our next visit. Very authentic Japanese cuisine. Service is very attentive. Lunch tasting menu is way worth the price! Strongly recommend! P.S.: although I am pregnant, the lunch tasting menu has all-cooked choices for me! I also noticed that the executive chef was always in the kitchen to ensure all the food come out right, which I really appreciate.Overall, a very pleasant dining experience. Will definitely come back! I had the best tasting menu experience ever in NYC here at Brushstroke.  Just to give you context, I find most tasting menus to be too long (Eleven Madison Park killed me at over 4 hours).  Brushstroke has a $135 8 course tasting menu (Kaiseki) that changes seasonally, and we were there for just over 3 hours.  Japanese cuisine lends itself well to tasting menus because many of the foods are more clean-tasting, fresh and light... which is perfect for multiple courses. We had the Winter Kaiseki Tasting Menu.  Seven out of the eight courses were phenomenal.  I felt that each course was just the right amount of food (again, another EMP comparison is that theirs were unsatisfying bite-size courses).  Plus, everything was served in a timely manner.  A few minutes after finishing each course (time enough to talk about it and relax), the very efficient servers whisked everything away.  The courses ranged all different styles: soup, rice, sashimi, fish, etc.  The one course that fell flat was the one that just had a lot of stuff going on -- there were oysters, battered cod and oysters, salmon covered under foam(?), two slices of duck, and some kind of roll.  Visually, the oyster was off-putting given it's huge size and the pink sauce it was floating in; meanwhile, the duck seemed out of place amongst all the seafood.  The cod and the salmon was the best part of the course. By the end, we were all stuffed.  The last course is dessert, and while I always have room for dessert.... I was struggling here.  If you want to end on a refreshing, light note, go with the whatever sorbet option is on there.  We had the lime sorbet and it was delicious.My friends got the $100 wine and sake pairing and LOVED the choices made by the highly educated and clearly-passionate-about-his-job sommelier.  Next time, I'll go for that choice.I'd highly recommend this place for: People who love Japanese and are looking for something delicious that isn't sushisushisushiPeople going on dates.  That place has a very warm ambiance and isn't terribly big.Special occasions that won't break the bank Great Service, very fresh sushi / sashimi on the kaiseki menu. Came here for my little sister's early birthday lunch and as they saw my note on open table to surprise her, that's exactly what they did. I wouldn't have expected any less but I'm glad they remembered and that was a definite plus. We had the 7 course tasting menu - definite fan of the pate - so good - we cleaned the bowl on that one, the yellowtail tartare on the cracker - amazing - the rice cake one was semi ok - I think it would've been better if it was with the cracker instead of the rice cake. We moved on to our next course of the sashimi of the day as well as our various salmon bowls and the lobster and shrimp noodle soup (FYI this is no noodles in there even though the menu had said noodles - basically just lobster and shrimp flavored soup with two pieces of each - can't complain though, it was very fresh). I also very much enjoyed my last dish the premium sashimi with a supplement - well worth it - so fresh - loved that they had uni and tuna in the box - so good and paired well with their version of the miso soup. I also enjoyed the fact that they had actual Japanese sushi chefs and not what you see so often these days - Chinese who pretend to be sushi chefs?? usually at those AYCE places - no go! Not to look down upon it - but I feel like the best Japanese places need to be authentic. Very much enjoyed their passionfruit cocktail dessert as well as the teapudding - one of the must-go's on my list crossed off! :) Had an impeccable dining experience here at Brushstroke NYC. We went with the $135/pp kaiseki fixed meal and it came with 8 different courses. This time of year, they have the spring menu. Wish I could remember all of the name of the dishes but unfortunately, I don't. Either way, the food was absolutely delicious and the chef executed the meals so beautifully!My S/O and I enjoyed every plate. I suggest getting the beef sirloin, lobster miso soup, and the eel ! The service was also amazing, just what you expect in a high end restaurant. Our sommelier, Joshua C. was so knowledgable and very accommodating! He suggested the perfect wine and cocktails with our food. We really enjoyed the experience and we can't wait to go back for more! Early spring kaiseki available now ($135 pp), along w/ their a la carte menu for dinner.Highly recommend the sashimi, miyazaki wagyu (Oregon washu - non-upgrade - is just as good), eel hitsumabushi, and chirashi upgrades, if ordering the kaiseki.Excellent service.Highest recommendation.: 10 calendars We ordered the omakase menu. A-la-Carte is available as well. Food is amazing! Very creative in plate decorations and raw materials picks. More importantly, the food tastes great. They offer a long wine and sake list - you'll be able to spot something you want. Great service too. The ambience and setting is good for both small or large groups. Reservation is not hard to make and can be made via Open Table. I just can't think of any downside. Worth a second visit. My husband decided on our date day to eat at a Japanese restaurant for lunch in the SoHo area after some shopping and walking around at Rockefeller center. There was plenty of metered parking spaces nearby because most people were traveling on Christmas Eve to see their families. We however, took the train here to avoid the traffic hassle. This place had excellent service from when we walked in until we finished our lunch date. There was a limited Christmas lunch menu (3 fixed options: 4-course, 6-course and 4-course vegetarian) that we were quite disappointed about but we decided on the 4-course menu. All 4 courses had excellent flavor and they were put together in a unique fashion so you were not overly full at the end of the meal. Our 1st course was the amuse-bouche, which consists of 3 different hors d'oeuvres according to the chef's selection. Then we each received a complimentary piece of yellowtail scallion hand roll to wrap ourselves. The 2nd course was the chawanmushi, a traditional Japanese savory custard made with winter mushrooms & truffle ankake. Our 3rd and 4th courses were different because he got the stewed pork cheek and shrimp with egg over rice while I got the Norway salmon and stewed beef cheek over ankake rice. All the food tasted fantastic but it didn't fit our simple food pallet. Although, it is nice to switch things up at times so we will definitely be back again in the future for dinner when we can order off the full menu. In a city where asian food is held at a high standard, Brushtroke does an excellent job at creating a perfect experience with authentic and creative flavors as well as a cozy atmosphere.The staff if attentive and knowledgeable. I loved sitting at the bar, which was still cozy and private.The dishes were creative and the flavors carried much depth. Plating was lovely. Very good value. Each course is legit and delicious. Love that we were not too full after the whole meal like other tasting menus we had before...The first course starts very refreshing, with sashimi urchin, scallop, strawberry foaming. My favorite dish is the seafood stew soup, with lobster, cod fish, etc. It has many flavors, and super delicious! We came with a group of 6 friends, so were able to try most of the dishes! Some personal tips on the dishes:1. The shrimp over rice is more popular among us. The rice with egg yolk was super tender.2. We all like the duck breast more than the salmon. It was very tender, and the seasoning is just right. Salmon is a little bit dry and feels like miso is better cooked with Cod than salmon.3. We tried all the dessert! And here's our rating.    Creme Brulee, Hojicha-Tea Pudding, Matcha-Green Tea Ice Cream& soy sauce gelato puff, Matcha cake, beets ice cream, passion fruit sorbet.The creme brulee and Hojich-tea pudding were definitely our favorite.The soy sauce gelato was definitely very interesting, not bad at all! Not a big fan of beets, and the ice cream is indeed okay...It was my first Kaiseki experience. Definitely loved it! Only one downside is a lot of the dish were very standard, like sashimi, sushi were pretty common as many other restaurants. Guess it supposed to like that? But in general, the value of the meal was very good. Would definitely love to go back some other time! When you come to miss Japanese food in NY, this place may satisfy your desire. Amazing food! I love love love the hand rolls!We came in for a Saturday brunch. The portions were just right and you don't feel stuffed as you usually would from these omakase menus. The teas were amazing, be sure to try the hojicha. The food is very authentically Japanese.The service was incredible too. I would definitely return, want to try out their dinner menu! I feel heartbroken Michelin removed their stars, they totally deserve their stars back! Wonderful! What a treat to be able to have eaten here on my last (rainy) night in NY. Located in a tranquil neighborhood in Tribeca, this lovely kaiseki spot is busy so make rezzies. I was lucky enough to get seated at the bar to watch the chefs and his sous chefs in action the whole night.You HAVE to go with their tasting menu which is expensive at $135 pp by why else would you come here?

That place has a very warm ambiance and isn't terribly big.Special occasions that won't break the bank"," The only thing I would like to share: After finishing my lobster noddle,I found a fly in the soup. The waiter took my soup and direct to the kitchen WITHOUT any apology. After 10 minutes,he took a soup and said:You can finish the soup. We made it again.  I was like WTF??? I really need the soup? The waiter was so arrogance. There was no apology. In addition,the food was terrible. Not worth $175. It's like $50 level. I was here for Valentines day dinner and while the food was good, there were too many issues to give it anything better. The food was yummy and the chef was wonderful but I don't know if it was due to the overly busy holiday dinner but weird stuff kept happening. First we arrived 10 minutes before the 9 o'clock reservation time and we were seated in the waiting area which faces the bathroom. While we were seated there having drinks, a girl just straight up throws up on the floor like 3 feet away from us. Super gross, but it's not the restaurant's fault but it really made us lose our appetites right before the meal. Also, we were seated at freaking 9:45, 45 minutes after our reservation time. By the time we are seated we're starving and I'm a little buzzed since we were half way through the bottle of Sancerre. The chef comes out and does his thing and we eat a fairly delicious meal (except for the terrible choice of strawberry cream on the scallop and uni dish). The meal is about to end it's around 11:30, and by this time we are exhausted so we just want to go home and it's starting to get uncomfortably hot in there. We wanted to skip dessert and just get the check and leave so we ask for the bill. We wait like 10 minutes. We ask again. Wait another 10 minutes, by this time we are eating the dessert since we are stuck there. I ask again and this time they are like well we're having  issues with the machine or something and it was so frustrating because if they would just relay that info to us instead of us waiting for like 25 minutes for the bill it wouldn't have been as infuriating then just sitting there in the hot room not knowing why they aren't giving you the bill. So we finally do get our bill and we give them our credit card and they bring it back a while later and they forget to bring our credit cards back for a us and another couple. Anyhow, strange night and I don't know if it was worth the 500 plus we spent for 2. I went to Brushstroke for lunch and sat down at the counter. I ordered off the lunch tasting menu. For the zensai, I had the Florida golden crab and summer vegetable truffle anake chawanmushi, for the shiizakana, I had the grilled Scottish salmon with lemon yuan-yaki and for the rice entree, I had the simmered Fuji pork belly with sesame soy sauce over rice. The chwanmushi had a lot of truffle flavoring in it, which I felt took away from the taste of the crab, the egg was nice and creamy, and it had a touch of ginger in it. There were only a few pieces of ginger in it, so it wasn't overpowering the truffle flavor at all.The salmon was cooked closer to the well done side, with the skin on and topped with caviar and lemon yuan yaki. I prefer my salmon cooked medium to prevent it having a fishy taste, but with the lemon yuan yaki, it didn't taste fishy at all and had a bit of a sweet taste to it. Also, the skin on the salmon was nice and crispy, which I loved.The pork belly was tender and the sesame soy sauce reminded me of a more flavorful tahini. I was a little surprised by the cut of the pork belly, because I'm used to having it served in cubes or thick slices, whereas here, it was almost like thin slivers of bacon.For the record, I've been to Ichimura and I guess because I had such a great experience there, that my expectations were much higher for eating here. How come this place is still in business? Looking at the reviews, you wonder how valid an opinion on 'Yelp' is!? Meanwhile most of the more positive impressions came from first timers who got sucked in by the Michelin Star joke! Clearly not very experienced eaters who are there in a one off situation to celebrate a special event.. The 2017 guide hasn't listed the restaurant! What's that about? Horrible food. Disgusting management and poorly trained servers. I visited Brushstroke on 10/21/2016 to celebrate my anniversary. Although the restaurant is expensive, I wanted to splurge for an experience on our special occasion. The dinner started off well, with the hostess bringing over a complimentary glass of Champagne. I opted for the 8 course wine/sake pairing, per recommendation of the waitress. The first few courses were delicious and came out within a reasonable time. The sommelier seemed to know a lot about the drinks and explained that some may not taste well alone, but with the food pairing, it would go well. He was right and the first four courses seemed to go pretty well without any hiccups.25 minutes went by without anyone coming to visit our table. Eventually, after I raised my hand a few times, our waitress came over, apologized for the wait, and poured me my ""tasting glass"" for the next dish. Another 25 minutes or so went by before I had to flag someone down to ask what was the hold up with our next dish. The waiter explained that they are very busy but the food should be out shortly. Eventually, after almost an hour wait, we received our next dish. The rest of the meal was fine, and the food was indeed very good, especially the duck. They gave us an extra two desserts as an apology and an anniversary ""present"" but if I am spending $600+ for a dinner, I do not want an excuse that the kitchen is really busy. At the very least, someone should come to our table, explain why there is a delay instead of me trying to flag someone down.  Also - the sommelier kept rubbing his hands on the top of the wine and sake bottles for each of the pairings. Not a big deal (if you're not a germophobe), but pretty unsanitary and unprofessional in my opinion. TLDR: Great food, bad service. Spend your time (almost 4 hours) and money elsewhere. The only thing I would like to share: After finishing my lobster noddle,I found a fly in the soup. The waiter took my soup and direct to the kitchen WITHOUT any apology. After 10 minutes,he took a soup and said:You can finish the soup. We made it again.  I was like WTF??? I really need the soup? The waiter was so arrogance. There was no apology. In addition,the food was terrible. Not worth $175. It's like $50 level. I was here for Valentines day dinner and while the food was good, there were too many issues to give it anything better. The food was yummy and the chef was wonderful but I don't know if it was due to the overly busy holiday dinner but weird stuff kept happening. First we arrived 10 minutes before the 9 o'clock reservation time and we were seated in the waiting area which faces the bathroom. While we were seated there having drinks, a girl just straight up throws up on the floor like 3 feet away from us. Super gross, but it's not the restaurant's fault but it really made us lose our appetites right before the meal. Also, we were seated at freaking 9:45, 45 minutes after our reservation time. By the time we are seated we're starving and I'm a little buzzed since we were half way through the bottle of Sancerre. The chef comes out and does his thing and we eat a fairly delicious meal (except for the terrible choice of strawberry cream on the scallop and uni dish). The meal is about to end it's around 11:30, and by this time we are exhausted so we just want to go home and it's starting to get uncomfortably hot in there. We wanted to skip dessert and just get the check and leave so we ask for the bill. We wait like 10 minutes. We ask again. Wait another 10 minutes, by this time we are eating the dessert since we are stuck there. I ask again and this time they are like well we're having  issues with the machine or something and it was so frustrating because if they would just relay that info to us instead of us waiting for like 25 minutes for the bill it wouldn't have been as infuriating then just sitting there in the hot room not knowing why they aren't giving you the bill. So we finally do get our bill and we give them our credit card and they bring it back a while later and they forget to bring our credit cards back for a us and another couple. Anyhow, strange night and I don't know if it was worth the 500 plus we spent for 2. I went to Brushstroke for lunch and sat down at the counter. I ordered off the lunch tasting menu. For the zensai, I had the Florida golden crab and summer vegetable truffle anake chawanmushi, for the shiizakana, I had the grilled Scottish salmon with lemon yuan-yaki and for the rice entree, I had the simmered Fuji pork belly with sesame soy sauce over rice. The chwanmushi had a lot of truffle flavoring in it, which I felt took away from the taste of the crab, the egg was nice and creamy, and it had a touch of ginger in it. There were only a few pieces of ginger in it, so it wasn't overpowering the truffle flavor at all.The salmon was cooked closer to the well done side, with the skin on and topped with caviar and lemon yuan yaki. I prefer my salmon cooked medium to prevent it having a fishy taste, but with the lemon yuan yaki, it didn't taste fishy at all and had a bit of a sweet taste to it. Also, the skin on the salmon was nice and crispy, which I loved.The pork belly was tender and the sesame soy sauce reminded me of a more flavorful tahini. I was a little surprised by the cut of the pork belly, because I'm used to having it served in cubes or thick slices, whereas here, it was almost like thin slivers of bacon.For the record, I've been to Ichimura and I guess because I had such a great experience there, that my expectations were much higher for eating here.

By the time we are seated we're starving and I'm a little buzzed since we were half way through the bottle of Sancerre. The chef comes out and does his thing and we eat a fairly delicious meal (except for the terrible choice of strawberry cream on the scallop and uni dish). The meal is about to end it's around 11:30, and by this time we are exhausted so we just want to go home and it's starting to get uncomfortably hot in there. We wanted to skip dessert and just get the check and leave so we ask for the bill. We wait like 10 minutes. We ask again. Wait another 10 minutes, by this time we are eating the dessert since we are stuck there. I ask again and this time they are like well we're having  issues with the machine or something and it was so frustrating because if they would just relay that info to us instead of us waiting for like 25 minutes for the bill it wouldn't have been as infuriating then just sitting there in the hot room not knowing why they aren't giving you the bill. So we finally do get our bill and we give them our credit card and they bring it back a while later and they forget to bring our credit cards back for a us and another couple. Anyhow, strange night and I don't know if it was worth the 500 plus we spent for 2. I went to Brushstroke for lunch and sat down at the counter. I ordered off the lunch tasting menu. For the zensai, I had the Florida golden crab and summer vegetable truffle anake chawanmushi, for the shiizakana, I had the grilled Scottish salmon with lemon yuan-yaki and for the rice entree, I had the simmered Fuji pork belly with sesame soy sauce over rice. The chwanmushi had a lot of truffle flavoring in it, which I felt took away from the taste of the crab, the egg was nice and creamy, and it had a touch of ginger in it. There were only a few pieces of ginger in it, so it wasn't overpowering the truffle flavor at all.The salmon was cooked closer to the well done side, with the skin on and topped with caviar and lemon yuan yaki. I prefer my salmon cooked medium to prevent it having a fishy taste, but with the lemon yuan yaki, it didn't taste fishy at all and had a bit of a sweet taste to it. Also, the skin on the salmon was nice and crispy, which I loved.The pork belly was tender and the sesame soy sauce reminded me of a more flavorful tahini. I was a little surprised by the cut of the pork belly, because I'm used to having it served in cubes or thick slices, whereas here, it was almost like thin slivers of bacon.For the record, I've been to Ichimura and I guess because I had such a great experience there, that my expectations were much higher for eating here. How come this place is still in business? Looking at the reviews, you wonder how valid an opinion on 'Yelp' is!? Meanwhile most of the more positive impressions came from first timers who got sucked in by the Michelin Star joke! Clearly not very experienced eaters who are there in a one off situation to celebrate a special event.. The 2017 guide hasn't listed the restaurant! What's that about? Horrible food. Disgusting management and poorly trained servers. I visited Brushstroke on 10/21/2016 to celebrate my anniversary. Although the restaurant is expensive, I wanted to splurge for an experience on our special occasion. The dinner started off well, with the hostess bringing over a complimentary glass of Champagne. I opted for the 8 course wine/sake pairing, per recommendation of the waitress. The first few courses were delicious and came out within a reasonable time. The sommelier seemed to know a lot about the drinks and explained that some may not taste well alone, but with the food pairing, it would go well. He was right and the first four courses seemed to go pretty well without any hiccups.25 minutes went by without anyone coming to visit our table. Eventually, after I raised my hand a few times, our waitress came over, apologized for the wait, and poured me my ""tasting glass"" for the next dish. Another 25 minutes or so went by before I had to flag someone down to ask what was the hold up with our next dish. The waiter explained that they are very busy but the food should be out shortly. Eventually, after almost an hour wait, we received our next dish. The rest of the meal was fine, and the food was indeed very good, especially the duck. They gave us an extra two desserts as an apology and an anniversary ""present"" but if I am spending $600+ for a dinner, I do not want an excuse that the kitchen is really busy. At the very least, someone should come to our table, explain why there is a delay instead of me trying to flag someone down.  Also - the sommelier kept rubbing his hands on the top of the wine and sake bottles for each of the pairings. Not a big deal (if you're not a germophobe), but pretty unsanitary and unprofessional in my opinion. TLDR: Great food, bad service. Spend your time (almost 4 hours) and money elsewhere. The only thing I would like to share: After finishing my lobster noddle,I found a fly in the soup. The waiter took my soup and direct to the kitchen WITHOUT any apology. After 10 minutes,he took a soup and said:You can finish the soup. We made it again.  I was like WTF??? I really need the soup? The waiter was so arrogance. There was no apology. In addition,the food was terrible. Not worth $175. It's like $50 level. I was here for Valentines day dinner and while the food was good, there were too many issues to give it anything better. The food was yummy and the chef was wonderful but I don't know if it was due to the overly busy holiday dinner but weird stuff kept happening. First we arrived 10 minutes before the 9 o'clock reservation time and we were seated in the waiting area which faces the bathroom.

Clearly not very experienced eaters who are there in a one off situation to celebrate a special event.. The 2017 guide hasn't listed the restaurant! What's that about? Horrible food. Disgusting management and poorly trained servers. I visited Brushstroke on 10/21/2016 to celebrate my anniversary. Although the restaurant is expensive, I wanted to splurge for an experience on our special occasion. The dinner started off well, with the hostess bringing over a complimentary glass of Champagne. I opted for the 8 course wine/sake pairing, per recommendation of the waitress. The first few courses were delicious and came out within a reasonable time. The sommelier seemed to know a lot about the drinks and explained that some may not taste well alone, but with the food pairing, it would go well. He was right and the first four courses seemed to go pretty well without any hiccups.25 minutes went by without anyone coming to visit our table. Eventually, after I raised my hand a few times, our waitress came over, apologized for the wait, and poured me my ""tasting glass"" for the next dish. Another 25 minutes or so went by before I had to flag someone down to ask what was the hold up with our next dish. The waiter explained that they are very busy but the food should be out shortly. Eventually, after almost an hour wait, we received our next dish. The rest of the meal was fine, and the food was indeed very good, especially the duck. They gave us an extra two desserts as an apology and an anniversary ""present"" but if I am spending $600+ for a dinner, I do not want an excuse that the kitchen is really busy. At the very least, someone should come to our table, explain why there is a delay instead of me trying to flag someone down.  Also - the sommelier kept rubbing his hands on the top of the wine and sake bottles for each of the pairings. Not a big deal (if you're not a germophobe), but pretty unsanitary and unprofessional in my opinion. TLDR: Great food, bad service. Spend your time (almost 4 hours) and money elsewhere. The only thing I would like to share: After finishing my lobster noddle,I found a fly in the soup. The waiter took my soup and direct to the kitchen WITHOUT any apology. After 10 minutes,he took a soup and said:You can finish the soup. We made it again.  I was like WTF??? I really need the soup? The waiter was so arrogance. There was no apology. In addition,the food was terrible. Not worth $175. It's like $50 level. I was here for Valentines day dinner and while the food was good, there were too many issues to give it anything better. The food was yummy and the chef was wonderful but I don't know if it was due to the overly busy holiday dinner but weird stuff kept happening. First we arrived 10 minutes before the 9 o'clock reservation time and we were seated in the waiting area which faces the bathroom. While we were seated there having drinks, a girl just straight up throws up on the floor like 3 feet away from us. Super gross, but it's not the restaurant's fault but it really made us lose our appetites right before the meal. Also, we were seated at freaking 9:45, 45 minutes after our reservation time. By the time we are seated we're starving and I'm a little buzzed since we were half way through the bottle of Sancerre. The chef comes out and does his thing and we eat a fairly delicious meal (except for the terrible choice of strawberry cream on the scallop and uni dish). The meal is about to end it's around 11:30, and by this time we are exhausted so we just want to go home and it's starting to get uncomfortably hot in there. We wanted to skip dessert and just get the check and leave so we ask for the bill. We wait like 10 minutes. We ask again. Wait another 10 minutes, by this time we are eating the dessert since we are stuck there. I ask again and this time they are like well we're having  issues with the machine or something and it was so frustrating because if they would just relay that info to us instead of us waiting for like 25 minutes for the bill it wouldn't have been as infuriating then just sitting there in the hot room not knowing why they aren't giving you the bill. So we finally do get our bill and we give them our credit card and they bring it back a while later and they forget to bring our credit cards back for a us and another couple. Anyhow, strange night and I don't know if it was worth the 500 plus we spent for 2. I went to Brushstroke for lunch and sat down at the counter. I ordered off the lunch tasting menu. For the zensai, I had the Florida golden crab and summer vegetable truffle anake chawanmushi, for the shiizakana, I had the grilled Scottish salmon with lemon yuan-yaki and for the rice entree, I had the simmered Fuji pork belly with sesame soy sauce over rice. The chwanmushi had a lot of truffle flavoring in it, which I felt took away from the taste of the crab, the egg was nice and creamy, and it had a touch of ginger in it. There were only a few pieces of ginger in it, so it wasn't overpowering the truffle flavor at all.The salmon was cooked closer to the well done side, with the skin on and topped with caviar and lemon yuan yaki. I prefer my salmon cooked medium to prevent it having a fishy taste, but with the lemon yuan yaki, it didn't taste fishy at all and had a bit of a sweet taste to it. Also, the skin on the salmon was nice and crispy, which I loved.The pork belly was tender and the sesame soy sauce reminded me of a more flavorful tahini. I was a little surprised by the cut of the pork belly, because I'm used to having it served in cubes or thick slices, whereas here, it was almost like thin slivers of bacon.For the record, I've been to Ichimura and I guess because I had such a great experience there, that my expectations were much higher for eating here.

1,CUT by Wol,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cut-by-wolfgang-puck-new-york-5?osq=Restaurants,"Steakhouses,American(New),Breakfast&Brunch",30.0,22.0,18.0,40.0," I came here on a Friday night for an impromptu dinner with my brother.  Fortunately we seemed to have a better experience than others have reported on Yelp. We enjoyed our food although the service was a bit lacking.- Ambiance : The decor is interesting and not typical of a steak house, which was a nice change.  The chairs are comfortable and they played really great music and an appropriate level (think classic rock). - Service : they took our coats/umbrellas upon arrival. When being seated, the hostess brought us back to the entry so they could ""clear the additional 2 place settings"" that we didn't need. They could have done this while we sat down.  The meal lacked a ""personal experience"" that I'm used to, none of the staff were really personable and just seemed to be there to do their job.  I'm honestly not sure who our waiter was as no one introduced them self claiming this role.  One person took our drink order, another arrived holding a tray of various cuts of meat and also took our order.  The same person who took our drink order returned to take our dessert order and checked in on us after we received our food.  The bus boy refilled our water and someone brought us bread/butter, but several times throughout the meal we had to flag down an employee.  We were there for 3 hours before we caught someones attention to request the bill- Food : After we ordered we were brought these dreamy little cheesy-puff knots, I could have eaten an entire basket of them.  Another employee came around with a tray of assorted breads, I'd recommend the pretzel knot.  Both of us really enjoyed our steaks, they were cooked to the correct temperature (medium rare, is there really any other way?).  We both had filets, one bone in, one grass-fed at $58 each.  Each steak includes 1 sauce at no cost, I don't really understand the need for a sauce if the meat is good, but we selected the red wine and Bearnaise sauce.  They were nice, but we both prefer our steaks plain.  For sides we ordered the mac & cheese and yukon whipped potatoes.  Both were very delicious, but the portions could have been a little more generous for the $16/$12 price tags.  The dessert options were a little too sophisticated for our taste, but we ordered the chocolate souffle which was quite decadent. Somewhere toward the end of our meal we were presented with 2 complimentary truffles.  Had I known this I might have skipped the $14 souffle. Love the vibe and decor as soon as we walked in.  Its very hip, trendy and not up tight like some steak houses.  Chairs are very comfortable, staff were very friendly and helpful. Every dish we ordered was super delicious.  Steak was cooked perfectly.The only thing we wished for was warm bread. It was disappointing to receive cold breads. People complained about the prices on yelp but what do you expect in a Wolfgang NY steak house located inside the 4 seasons hotel? Ate breakfast here during a stay at the Four Seasons. I tried the smoked salmon/egg avocado toast which was pretty good, despite initially thinking it might be a bit heavy. The eggs were poached perfectly, with creamy, runny yolks. I also ordered a fresh-squeezed orange juice and cappuccino, both of which were fine. Service was fair, unobtrusive but attentive enough. I liked the trendy decor, and there's an interesting bar in the evenings as well. Cut overall score: 80Wolfgang Puck just opened up a new location of his steakhouse ""Cut"" in downtown Manhattan. Of course I had to check it out. A buddy and I came here with our ladies to get down on some steak.Flavor: 8We were able to sample three different cuts: rib eye, sirloin and tenderloin. All three hailed from Creekstone Farms, and all three were bone-in.The rib eye here is a solid 8/10. It felt a bit small for 20oz, but as you can see it had a great outer crust.Inside was perfectly cooked. Check out the cut:Where it fell short, for me, was the cap. There wasn't much to it, unfortunately. The eye was delicious though, and I think it was the most flavorful cut of the night. I didn't get pics of the other two.I'm giving the tenderloin a 9/10. It had that same great sear and same great cook temp. The flavor was excellent for a tenderloin, too.The sirloin was not marketed as a NY strip or strip loin, so I am considering it to be an ""other cut"" for categorization purposes. In all likelihood, it was probably a strip, but one can never be certain without actually doing the butchering oneself. This was an 8/10. Again, same great crisp and cook, and the flavor was nice for a lean cut, though I did prefer the rib eye and tenderloin over the sirloin.As for the sauces, well, each steak comes with a free sauce on the side. There are about six to eight to choose from. We tried a bunch: house steak sauce, bernaise, creamy horseradish, and yuzu. While I prefer my steak naked, the best of the lot was the horseradish. Their house steak sauce was a bit aggressive on the tarragon (I think that's what it was in there - not rosemary).Choice of Cuts & Quality Available: 10This place is truly amazing in terms of available cuts and quality. A quick scan of their menu reveals that they not only offer all of the main steakhouse cuts in various sizes, but you can also choose by farm. They offer stuff from Kansas (Creekstone), Illinois (corn-finished), Ithaca New York (grass-finished), and Snake River (American Wagyu). On top of that, they feature legit Miyazaki beef from Japan as well. You can even order a tasting that will give you 4oz from various farms, that way you can actually taste the difference between them. Currently, they only do this with the sirloin - not the rib eye. Honestly I don't think any other steakhouse has this extensive of a selection.As if the cuts of beef for steaks aren't enough variety, they also feature wagyu beef short rib and wagyu beef sashimi. Amazing.Oh, and they bring the shit out to show you, too.Portion Size & Plating: 7Portions could be a bit larger here for the pricing. I understand the cost of high-end beef, but at $88 for 9oz of American wagyu rib eye, you are getting ripped off. If that's what I am going for, I will happily just head the fuck over to Del Frisco's to get 23oz more wagyu beef for an additional $7 (32oz, $95). And that fucker is a clear 10/10 score on flavor - one of the best steaks I've ever eaten.Price: 5See my rant on portion size above for some weight here as well. But in addition to that issue, I felt that some of the items were way overpriced for what we were getting. In particular, the marrow app, the tortolloni, and the mac and cheese.Bar: 8The bar is pretty cool, and there are some great cocktails and booze selections available. However the prices are a bit too high (a non-alcoholic ""mocktail"" was fucking $14), and I was hoping for a more street side experience. The bar is just off the lobby of the apartment building / hotel with no view of the downtown streets, so the vibe is slightly off a bit.Specials and Other Meats: 9There are no off-menu specials, with the exception of an addition that was not yet printed - another offering of steak. But there's chicken, pork and lamb for alternative meat selections, if for some reason you are avoiding all the tasty beef on the menu. The app selections also feature veal tongue, suckling pig, and bone marrow flan. Really interesting.Apps, Sides & Desserts: 9We tried a bunch of stuff. Let's get right down to business.The mac and cheese was really tasty, but insanely overpriced at $16. Apologies for not getting a photo of it.The suckling pig and pork belly was excellent. Not as salty as I was expecting, but really nicely plated. Also overpriced at $25 for six cubes that were the size of large Las Vegas gambling dice.Bone marrow flan was very nice, but overpriced and small in size. It was similar to the creme brulee from Beatrice Inn, only savory.Broccolini was fantastic. I highly recommend this item. Topped with shaved cheese and adorned with roasted tomatoes, one cannot possibly go wrong.Tortolloni was overpriced for seven small dumplings. They were nice and mild though, which is exactly what my wife wanted.Doughnuts dessert came with about six doughnut holes, all the same flavor (granulated sugar coated)....REVIEW CUT FOR LENGTH- go to my site for the rest if you give a fuck Breakfast review. Wolfgang Puck's first Manhattan foray at the Four Seasons. Super sumptuous dining room and British matre d. Ate: Sparrow bush eggs, hash browns, stewed tomato, bacon, rye toast- $18Green juice-$12DecafThe eggs were fluffy and delish, crispy hash browns, fresh hot bacon and a lovely stewed tomato. The coffee didn't make the cut though. Watery like the Clocktower, I was told it was Wolfgang's own. Well, Wolfie, we have exceptional coffee roasted in NYC, fyi. I came here for dinner around 7 and was packed, I was happy that we had a reservation . Beautiful place, hostess were really friendly and polite, waiters were so knowledgeable about menu terms , freshly baked bread which was so yummy, try the onion it's so tasty.We have the lobster  and  tuna tartar for starter, the plating was very nice and detailed and for main as I had steamed sea bass which was in Thai sauce and served with brown rice was so tasty and seasoning was just right. I loved the dish and it was packed and here you never felt waiter are rushing you go leave the table.I highly recommend this place, I really gonna come back for brunch here soon Fantastic brunch. The avocado toast was amazing! The service ended up being good since the restaurant manager ended up serving us. Must have been short on staff. Popped in here for a pre-dinner drinks. The drinks were excellent, fancy and the cost reflected that. The ambiance was really cool, dark and moody. The music was also surprisingly good, Pink Floyd and the like. It was Saturday around 7pm and we had to stalk a few tables to get a seat. The bar was full and the space is pretty tiny. The bartender was super friendly and very good at what she does. I would definitely come back. Went for the Valentine's Day Prixe Fixe. What an amazing experience! Cocktails are wonderful. The bread and amuse bouche (Wagyu sliders and Caviar) were a great start. We both chose the tortelloni with black truffle were amazing and somehow light. I had the Wagyu short rib while my husband had the chicken. The sides were creamed spinach with fried egg, roasted brussel sprouts with bacon, and patatas bravas and were delicious. The shaved strawberries with lychee sorbet and champagne was a wonderful palate cleanser. Dessert of raspberry goat cheese doughtnuts and boca negra followed by truffles left little room to even possibly eat anything else. Perfection! Ordered takeout once again from here last night. It was exceptional and Taylor, the maitre d, impressed me with her knowledge of the menu. She offered great suggestions. My boyfriend and I shared the 20 oz ribeye and it was excellent. The polenta and brussel sprouts were delicious accompaniments. This time I ordered two orders of the homemade tortelloni because it was amazing the first time I tried it and the portion size is not very big. Taylor was very thoughtful and kind in providing us with a complimentary dessert for my boyfriends birthday, what a nice surprise. The food, drinks, presentation, and service are all superb here. Service was a little slow but it was their first day. My husband and I came for lunch and we recommend the burger and gin, egg white martini. It's about time Wolfgang Puck opened a restaurant in NYC. My husband and I will definitely be back to try their dinner menu soon. I came here on a Friday night for an impromptu dinner with my brother.  Fortunately we seemed to have a better experience than others have reported on Yelp. We enjoyed our food although the service was a bit lacking.- Ambiance : The decor is interesting and not typical of a steak house, which was a nice change.  The chairs are comfortable and they played really great music and an appropriate level (think classic rock). - Service : they took our coats/umbrellas upon arrival. When being seated, the hostess brought us back to the entry so they could ""clear the additional 2 place settings"" that we didn't need. They could have done this while we sat down.  The meal lacked a ""personal experience"" that I'm used to, none of the staff were really personable and just seemed to be there to do their job.  I'm honestly not sure who our waiter was as no one introduced them self claiming this role.  One person took our drink order, another arrived holding a tray of various cuts of meat and also took our order.  The same person who took our drink order returned to take our dessert order and checked in on us after we received our food.  The bus boy refilled our water and someone brought us bread/butter, but several times throughout the meal we had to flag down an employee.  We were there for 3 hours before we caught someones attention to request the bill- Food : After we ordered we were brought these dreamy little cheesy-puff knots, I could have eaten an entire basket of them.  Another employee came around with a tray of assorted breads, I'd recommend the pretzel knot.  Both of us really enjoyed our steaks, they were cooked to the correct temperature (medium rare, is there really any other way?).  We both had filets, one bone in, one grass-fed at $58 each.  Each steak includes 1 sauce at no cost, I don't really understand the need for a sauce if the meat is good, but we selected the red wine and Bearnaise sauce.  They were nice, but we both prefer our steaks plain.  For sides we ordered the mac & cheese and yukon whipped potatoes.  Both were very delicious, but the portions could have been a little more generous for the $16/$12 price tags.  The dessert options were a little too sophisticated for our taste, but we ordered the chocolate souffle which was quite decadent. Somewhere toward the end of our meal we were presented with 2 complimentary truffles.  Had I known this I might have skipped the $14 souffle. Love the vibe and decor as soon as we walked in.  Its very hip, trendy and not up tight like some steak houses.  Chairs are very comfortable, staff were very friendly and helpful. Every dish we ordered was super delicious.  Steak was cooked perfectly.The only thing we wished for was warm bread. It was disappointing to receive cold breads. People complained about the prices on yelp but what do you expect in a Wolfgang NY steak house located inside the 4 seasons hotel? Ate breakfast here during a stay at the Four Seasons. I tried the smoked salmon/egg avocado toast which was pretty good, despite initially thinking it might be a bit heavy. The eggs were poached perfectly, with creamy, runny yolks. I also ordered a fresh-squeezed orange juice and cappuccino, both of which were fine. Service was fair, unobtrusive but attentive enough. I liked the trendy decor, and there's an interesting bar in the evenings as well. Cut overall score: 80Wolfgang Puck just opened up a new location of his steakhouse ""Cut"" in downtown Manhattan. Of course I had to check it out. A buddy and I came here with our ladies to get down on some steak.Flavor: 8We were able to sample three different cuts: rib eye, sirloin and tenderloin. All three hailed from Creekstone Farms, and all three were bone-in.The rib eye here is a solid 8/10. It felt a bit small for 20oz, but as you can see it had a great outer crust.Inside was perfectly cooked. Check out the cut:Where it fell short, for me, was the cap. There wasn't much to it, unfortunately. The eye was delicious though, and I think it was the most flavorful cut of the night. I didn't get pics of the other two.I'm giving the tenderloin a 9/10. It had that same great sear and same great cook temp. The flavor was excellent for a tenderloin, too.The sirloin was not marketed as a NY strip or strip loin, so I am considering it to be an ""other cut"" for categorization purposes. In all likelihood, it was probably a strip, but one can never be certain without actually doing the butchering oneself. This was an 8/10. Again, same great crisp and cook, and the flavor was nice for a lean cut, though I did prefer the rib eye and tenderloin over the sirloin.As for the sauces, well, each steak comes with a free sauce on the side. There are about six to eight to choose from. We tried a bunch: house steak sauce, bernaise, creamy horseradish, and yuzu. While I prefer my steak naked, the best of the lot was the horseradish. Their house steak sauce was a bit aggressive on the tarragon (I think that's what it was in there - not rosemary).Choice of Cuts & Quality Available: 10This place is truly amazing in terms of available cuts and quality. A quick scan of their menu reveals that they not only offer all of the main steakhouse cuts in various sizes, but you can also choose by farm. They offer stuff from Kansas (Creekstone), Illinois (corn-finished), Ithaca New York (grass-finished), and Snake River (American Wagyu). On top of that, they feature legit Miyazaki beef from Japan as well. You can even order a tasting that will give you 4oz from various farms, that way you can actually taste the difference between them. Currently, they only do this with the sirloin - not the rib eye. Honestly I don't think any other steakhouse has this extensive of a selection.As if the cuts of beef for steaks aren't enough variety, they also feature wagyu beef short rib and wagyu beef sashimi. Amazing.Oh, and they bring the shit out to show you, too.Portion Size & Plating: 7Portions could be a bit larger here for the pricing. I understand the cost of high-end beef, but at $88 for 9oz of American wagyu rib eye, you are getting ripped off. If that's what I am going for, I will happily just head the fuck over to Del Frisco's to get 23oz more wagyu beef for an additional $7 (32oz, $95). And that fucker is a clear 10/10 score on flavor - one of the best steaks I've ever eaten.Price: 5See my rant on portion size above for some weight here as well.

I realize they have only been open for 6 months, but the service experience there was one of the worst I've ever had anywhere in the world, including France... Our waiter (Pete) was a self-proclaimed professional with 30 years of fine dinning experience. Apparently, he never learned basic manners or polite etiquette during that time. He was smug, inattentive, and dismissive of our questions. When one of us felt their drink tasted a off, we inquired as to whether it was the correct liquor. His response was smug and stern. He made zero attempt to make the customer feel appreciated by offering a solution. The food was pretty good but not amazing. I've had much better steaks at many different places. In addition to our struggles with Pete, the overall service was painfully slow and we had to flag down a staff member for every single request. I think we would still be sitting there if he didn't aggressively ask for the meal to move along at every step. Wolfgang, you need to step in and change the culture here! I give this a 3 stars because the ambiance was amazing and the staff. I just didn't really like much the food. It wasn't something that amazed me or had enough flavor to. It could've been better. We had many appetizers and entrees but didn't really like it. The drinks were fantastic and good. We wanted to like this restaurant. We are locals, from TriBeCa, just six blocks up.  My husband and I took my mother and our 12 year old daughter.  Service was a 3 but food really a 1.  We asked somalier for a full bodied red for under $100.  She recommended, and we bought, a mediocre not full bodied red for $95. Not a good choice.  First two of us ordered the crispy softshell crab-- tasted like fried nothing-- way overbattered and under seasoned.  Our daughter had tuna tartare which was good and my husband had steak tartare which was mediocre.  We ordered porterhouse steak for two and lobster.  Both were priceless (""market price""). Both delivered cold. The lobster was okay but the steak was awful and full of grizzle. Who delivers porterhouse steak at room temperature?  It should have been sizzling. Very disappointing!  The price for porterhouse for 2-- $140!  Brussel sprouts and cream spinach pretty good. Wolfgang Puck, you should be ashamed of yourself. Devalued brand. Don't eat here!!! Sadly not a good experience.  FS Downtown is a beautiful hotel and the restaurant itself has a very nice bar and ambiance.  We were with friends and sat for drinks at the bar.  Each round of drinks (with the place very quite) took in excess of 15 minutes to get.  Our reservation was late and then once sat down we literally waited 45 mixtures to order.  Not an exaggeration.  Food is ok but very overpriced.  You can tell they got staff thinking this is a regular meat packing district restaurant.  At these prices you need a pro staff and everything need to be on point.  Dinner took literally three hours.  Just from a shear table turnover aspect they are not going to be able to make it.  We will not be returning.  As far as the food it was ok to good but certainly not on par with most any other NYC steakhouse.  Also at this price point have some comfortable chairs at least.  I will also say staff was very nice and pleasant if that counts for anything given the overall experience. So so so so disappointing service and food wise , with American cut and others so close there's no reason to ever go here unless u are a clueless tourist I've been counting down the days for this to open in my neighborhood. As we sat down there was a couple next to us complaining about how underwhelmed they were with the food. I initially thought they were being hard asses but after finishing my dinner, I sadly felt the same way.Service was great, staff was very friendly and the place itself is gorgeous. We started with the beef tartar which was just bland. The filet was cooked well but the sides were disappointing. Never have I ever not finished my Mac and cheese (grainy texture and lacked flavor). I ordered the cod bc I wanted a lighter option and after a few bites had no desire to finish it. Everything was fine, but nothing knocked my socks off. Not the ideal $200 dinner I was hoping for. Since it's on my street I might return to the bar for a drink but considering the amazing restaurants in Tribeca I can't guarantee I'll be back. I would recommend waiting a few months and letting them button everything up before trying it. We tried for a quiet business lunch; you could hear yourself talk (in private) but the service was up and down; people would come all at same time or disappear; as two women in business clothes we got stuck near the door to back when the place was 1/3 full; our burger was excellent thou.  Just  opened so needs time to shake it out I guess. the food here is just bad. didn't know it was possible to go to a bad steakhouse but everything we ordered (filet, steak sandwich, creamed spinach, onion rings) was just straight up bad. pretty disappointing considering the price you pay. also, the service was super slow, and to apologize they sent us two free desserts which were also just plain bad, like inedible. it was also super crowded from some event, and people were standing all around the lounge area and placing their drinks and popcorn snack on the table we were dining off of - just didn't feel like the normal expectation you'd have from a fine steakhouse, at all. don't think uncle puck would be proud. Added some stars because the restaurant made it right and gave us a great free breakfast. Mediocre is the best I can do... didn't hate it but that's the best I can offer.  Had dinner, drinks, breakfast and over multiple visits and days mediocrity was the only consistent part.  Food... appetizers were fine although ""precious"" with pointless edible flowers and micro greens.  Steak ""from a 1200 degree broiler"" was lukewarm and undercooked and worst, bland.   Water glasses empty...Bar service was good when the bar was empty and terrible with lack of manners by the bartenders.  Breakfast service slow, incompetent/untrained and rushed.  How can it be slow yet rushed... ah, the Wolfgang Puck secret... staff slow to notice or interact with customers yet rushing/buzzing about and inattentive at the table.  Breakfast food was fine but the croissants oily and rubbery, a delicious combo.  Wine list was good and for NYC reasonably priced. As much as I love Wolfgang, I can't bring myself to recommend Cut.

2,Aces - 20 ,https://www.yelp.com/biz/aces-queens-2?osq=Restaurants,SushiBars,5.0,4.0,1.0,5.0," Absolutely outstanding sushi! Easily the best sushi I've ever had. Of course, this was sushi flown in from Tsukiji Market in Tokyo, so it's as legit as sushi can be. I had the sushi platter with assorted nigiri and two spicy tuna rolls, and every piece was perfect. If you have courtside seats, it's downright crazy not to eat at Iron Chef Morimoto's place at the US Open. Note that I ate early in the day and avoided the rush, so service was outstanding. Apparently service might be an issue during busier times, which could interfere with time spent watching tennis, so plan (and make reservations) accordingly. This place gets lots of stars for the mere fact that it's a fabulous restaurant in the middle of a sporting event.  While the plebians are shoveling down hot dogs and guzzling down beer, you, oh-lucky-beholder of tickets to the exclusive ""Courtside Box seats"" or ""Luxury Suites"" will get access to Aces.  You will get to dine in a lovely, well-lit air-conditioned restaurant with waiters wearing aprons.  You will get to enjoy cloth table cloths and vases filled with flowers.  You will get a fancy basket of artisan bread brought to your table to nibble on with your sparkling water.  You will get to select from a menu of fresh fish and sushi as opposed to a ginormous pretzel or cracker jacks. But, let's be honest....  The food is WAY overpriced and frankly just not that great.  I don't really know what I was expecting, but I was kind of hoping for more than 6 tiny, fairly crappy pieces when I ordered my $14 (fourteen-dollar) spicy tuna roll.    They do have some other exciting things on the menu (think portabella fries and specialty tuna rolls).  You are definitely paying for the ambiance, the service, and the ""experience"" of eating at Aces when you come to the US Open.   The food is not as good as I was expecting, but then again, it was still better than the franks and fries from the ""Food Village."" Portobella fries, lobster salad, and the ahi sandwich were all really good. Best selection of food you will get at the stadium by far. Hands-down *the* pre-night session closing weekend spot to dine. Call well in advance for reservations."," As a party of eight, we wrapped up a  dinner at Aces in the last hour. We spent almost 3 hours at the table, enduring inexcusably inattentive service, completely mixed-up orders, and a general air of extreme mismanagement. The entrees literally took 2 hours to arrive, we received two orders that were meant for another table ( while the other six guests received nothing for another 15 minutes). When all the dishes arrived, one of the steaks was almost raw while one of the sushi orders was wrong. In the end, we asked the manager for his and his supervisor's names and other information so that we could make a formal complaint.  He refused to do that and then got angry when one of the guests took a photo of him, saying it was against ""my law"" to take photos, and threatened to call security on her. This was a terrible experience, I wish I could give it no star. Most importantly, we were there for so long that the first match of the evening started while we were still sitting in the restaurant - which was definitely not our intention as we had made a 5:45 reservation. Definitely avoid Aces. Eat elsewhere or before you get to the stadium.",$$$$,Yes,No,,,,,,,,,No,,Yes,Dressy,,,,No,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

American Cut is by far my favorite steak house that I have had the privilege dining at, which I have dined at the best in New York and Long Island. If you're reading this, do me a favor and just go!  I wrote this to benefit you and to show you that American Cut is well worth everything! Enjoy and I hope you have a wonderful dining experience as I always and will have ! All the best ! Great service.Excellent sea-food tower.Excellent company.For a steak place I was, however, let down. Asked for medium ribeye. There was no pink in sight. It was a well don't piece of leather.  Red meat for me is a dietary occasion. I expect a steak house to deliver. That is all they do. The meat was simply overcooked.I would ask for medium rare next and work your way up. I am absolutely blown away by American Cut! Where to start...1. The HAPPY HOUR is amazing - $10 specialty cocktail, $5 glasses of wine, $3 beer.. in Manhattan, at a nice steak house. What?! Ps - it ends at 7:30!2. The service. I booked on Open Table and mentioned we were celebrating a birthday. We didn't tell anyone upon arrival or when we were there and our server already knew and made sure to say happy birthday upon bringing out our desert, so nice! While walking out the amazing host remembered us from 3 hours prior and wished us a happy birthday again. That's something you can't find most places.Our server was perfectly attentive and made sure we had enough time to enjoy our evening and didn't pressure us to order anything or order more drinks. 3. Decor. Amazing - chic, classy, clean, great lighting. 4. THE FOOD. Okay, let's start with the free cheesy everything biscuits that are served with a side of veggie cream cheese butter - I could eat these every day for the rest of my life. What a great alternative to the standard bread and oil. The shrimp cocktail appetizer was phenomenal, as were the twice baked potatoes with truffle. For entrees we had the filet mignon and the chili lobster. Both were out of this world good. We topped off our food babies with the Cracker Jack sundae which was amazing as well. We left with the best feeling, knowing we had gotten a great deal on drinks, ate perfectly prepared food, and had the best service. Can't wait to come back again! This is my first Restaurant ""Week""/(month) venture for me during this summer run, and I have to say it started off quite strong.  Big fan of Marc Forgione, so I've been meaning to come here.Minor gripe on the atmosphere is that we were seated downstairs, which was fine in terms of ambiance, but it was a bit warm/muggy.  Otherwise, the service was prompt, courteous and helpful (helped me settle on a dry, albeit pricey cocktail.Food-wise, as others have noted, you are started off with complimentary warm 'everything'-style biscuits with a vegetable-infused butter spread.  The biscuit was very hearty, a little dry, but with the spread...I was incredibly tempted to ask for more...but I've been working on this 'self-control' thing. For appetizers we ordered:Jim Brady Oysters - Champagne, Black Truffle, Cruccola: a decadent and tasty dish, came with 3 oysters.Bacon, Schaller & Weber - MF Steak Sauce, Black Onion: Really tasty. Nice thick (and meaty/not all gristly!) cuts of bacon with a tangy bbq dipping sauce. Awesome.For our entrees, we ordered:Pastrami-spiced Hanger Steak - As a pastrami lover, wow. Oh man, winner winner.Bell & Evans Chicken - Natural Jus, Chili: They give you a really generous portion of nice and juicy cooked chicken.  I like-a de-jus.  The jus...it make-a it tasty goood. (props if you get the snl reference)We also just got one of each of the sides offered:Sunchoke Spinach, Fontina, Smoked Salt - nicely steamed spinach; helped me feel okay about eating the steak...and everything else.Potato Puree "" Robuchon"", Local Butter - rich, creamy, what's not to like?And for dessert, we ordered the: Cracker Jack Sundae - Really fun treat, with bits of caramel popcorn and other goodies. Blueberry Bread Pudding - A little dry for bread pudding, but with the mint basil ice cream, it was quite good.Great food, good times, definite plan on being back...restaurant week and otherwise. Came here for a birthday dinner and left 5lbs heavier and satisfied  Ordered the oysters and bacon for an appetizer - bacon is a must try.For the main course I ordered the ribeye - absolutely loved the flavor but I wish the dish came out sooner as it was colder than I would've liked.For the sides we ordered the fries, creamed spinach, and the truffle Mac and cheese (not on the menu) Overall I thought the sides were OK.As for the dessert - I HAD to order the Crackerjack Sundae - I'm not even a huge fan of crackerjack popcorn but I ate every last bit of the sundae. I'd come back just for this dessert. I enjoyed the service and atmosphere here. Steaks were delicious, not terribly pricey for NYC. We brought our own bottle of Caymus for $40 cork fee. Came here for lunch to try something off the new burger bar menu. Got the ""MFC"" which is a fried chicken sandwich on an everything biscuit with chili honey and pickles. Must say for $14 it's a pretty big portion which comes with fries and completely worth every penny. Strongly recommend this sandwich. Their service was great also. 105 is the magic number. I came here for their dry aged burger at the bar, and 105 is the magic number. It took me 105 chews to finally get myself to swallow the first bite. There is absolutely no way to formulate a description of this burger other than it is 100% worth every single bit of effort to go down here. Piece by piece breakdown of my meal coming up:1) The Dry Aged Burger (14$)The burger was phenomenal. Taking the first couple bites, you sometimes chew into a crunchy little crisp bite. That is the charred dry aged steak that has been perfectly cooked and crisped to a point. The delicious layer of cheese that drapes over this magnificent patty blankets the innocent, succulent little mushrooms, cowering away from the world. This review may seem a bit awkward, but I have to say, there is no better way to describe the burger... Do yourself a favor and just go get the burger.2) The Crab Cakes (19$)Solid home styled crab cakes, coated by corn flakes, apparently an old family recipe. It definitely shows with how full the flavor is. Paired with a tangy coleslaw, the crab cake is biased on top of a delicious glazed onion puree. Excellent pair with the crispy crab cake.3) Tater Tots? (8$)Meh... Good home styled tatertots with a rich home style ketchup, but honestly, I could have done without.4) Plank Roasted Bourbon (10$ on Happy Hour)This was a nice pairing to the burger. Nice and Rich with a definite smokey residue flavor, paired really well with the crisp of the burger. If you're gonna get the burger, get the Bourbon as well, it makes it all come together oh so well.All in all, this place is definitely a place to go and would 100% recommend making the effort to come here. *** Heads up, they only make a small amount of burgers a day, so go early to catch the burger and check their Twitter at approximately 4:30 daily because that's when they tell how many burgers they have for that night. This place was absolutely delicious! My girlfriend and I arrived a bit late for our reservation but we were still seated immediately. Our server was very attentive and made great suggestions without upselling us. We had the tomahawk steak, chili lobster, aged potatoes, and the hot oysters to start. Most of our choices was based on other yelp reviews. The steak was very tender and cooked truly medium rare as expected. I'd definitely recommend coming here and trying a flambe sauce, it smelled amazing but we missed that. We went here for a friends birthday. I arrived first as the reservation was under my name. The host said my party had gotten there and led me to the table. I immediately was like umm those aren't my friends. So, eventually they figured out they had given up our table in the bar area, but let us have the bar menu in the dining room. We enjoyed a bunch of apps and burgers for dinner. Everything was delicious and my burger was so rare it barely stayed together, just how I like it. Drinks were strong and we all left happy. Yummm... loved the ambiance, the food and the service! The chili lobster is a must,  haven't had something this good in a long time! The wait staff recommend us using the sauce to dip our steak in, and they are right, i liked it much better than the steak sauce provided.  We had the porterhouse for 2, very generous portion, but the edges were a bit too charred, hence the 4 star (rather than 5). You can't leave here without trying the crackerjack sundae! Looks big, but easy to finish bc how good it is. Would def return! Great service with solid sides. Te sides and appetizers were very good (especially the cheese grits) and a good selection of wines by the glass. I liked the idea that you could add sides to the steak like blue cheese and foie gras, or fried egg. Although I think if you add more than 1, the flavors get muddled.Why four stars instead of 5?  It's because the flavor of the filet mignon steak was nothing special. It didn't blow me away, it tasted like your usual USDA prime steak. After a very (very) late start due to a dining partner that had the worst public transit luck possible, I had a really great experience at American Cut. We actually lost our reservation due to the aforementioned lateness, but had no problem getting a cozy table near the bar, which also served the full menu. Probably preferred that seat over the deafening roar that came from the proper dining room next door, if I'm being honest.The meal started off with some delicious everything biscuits and vegetable butter (omg so good, one of the best free bread starters I've ever had). We also split an order of half dozen oysters, which were delicious though probably overpriced, and tuna tartare, which was probably the most disappointing part of the night (decent, but I'd rather have had something else). Our main was the tomahawk steak for two, which was a rather large and impressive cut of meat. We asked for it to be cooked medium rare, and it came out more on the rare side if anything, but that didn't stop us from devouring most of it. Mushrooms and polenta made for the perfect side (I'd come here again just for this).For dessert we split the berry buckle which, while not amazing, was a nice bite to end the meal.Service was very friendly throughout, and even while I was sitting there for 60+ minutes waiting for my friend (this offset the slightly icy hostesses). Drinks were strong and smooth - the best combination - and don't be afraid to ask for something not on the menu. My friend got a very good pisco sour made for him. After a year or so of anticipating Restaurant Week at American Cut, we finally set a date to go.I'll keep it short and sweet - this is a place you want to go if you're feeling fancy or want to impress a date, all while shoveling out some serious cash. The classy interior, food and service are all what you would expect of a Marc Forgione restaurant. I wouldn't classify this as a traditional steakhouse, as it's located in Greenwich Village and adopts a more modern, trendy image, but the steak itself will bring you right back. Don't skip the bread basket - mirroring what others have mentioned, the everything biscuits paired with vegetable compound butter are ten steps up from your regular toasted bagel in the morning. For the entree, I got the 9 oz. pastrami spiced hanger, which was incredibly flavorful and tender, and a side of fontina creamed spinach. Perfect accompaniment, perfect meal. I've been to American Cut several times over the past year and each time I was lucky enough to have had Anthony as my server. Anthony is well groomed and understands how to communicate to a customer both on a professional and personal level. He always makes the dinning experience truly exceptional and rememberable. Always pleased and grateful for his service. Moreover, the food in this establishment is phenomenal. To the homemade biscuits they start you off with to the main entrees you ordered, you're truly in for a treat and a tasteful experience. The Bone Marrow will have your taste buds in a place of wonder and awe, the Diamond Cut Jim Brady Oysters will open your eyes and palette into a new world that is unknown, yet so beautiful, and the Surf and Turf, well, is absolutely fantastic every single time!

I liked the idea that you could add sides to the steak like blue cheese and foie gras, or fried egg. Although I think if you add more than 1, the flavors get muddled.Why four stars instead of 5?  It's because the flavor of the filet mignon steak was nothing special. It didn't blow me away, it tasted like your usual USDA prime steak. After a very (very) late start due to a dining partner that had the worst public transit luck possible, I had a really great experience at American Cut. We actually lost our reservation due to the aforementioned lateness, but had no problem getting a cozy table near the bar, which also served the full menu. Probably preferred that seat over the deafening roar that came from the proper dining room next door, if I'm being honest.The meal started off with some delicious everything biscuits and vegetable butter (omg so good, one of the best free bread starters I've ever had). We also split an order of half dozen oysters, which were delicious though probably overpriced, and tuna tartare, which was probably the most disappointing part of the night (decent, but I'd rather have had something else). Our main was the tomahawk steak for two, which was a rather large and impressive cut of meat. We asked for it to be cooked medium rare, and it came out more on the rare side if anything, but that didn't stop us from devouring most of it. Mushrooms and polenta made for the perfect side (I'd come here again just for this).For dessert we split the berry buckle which, while not amazing, was a nice bite to end the meal.Service was very friendly throughout, and even while I was sitting there for 60+ minutes waiting for my friend (this offset the slightly icy hostesses). Drinks were strong and smooth - the best combination - and don't be afraid to ask for something not on the menu. My friend got a very good pisco sour made for him. After a year or so of anticipating Restaurant Week at American Cut, we finally set a date to go.I'll keep it short and sweet - this is a place you want to go if you're feeling fancy or want to impress a date, all while shoveling out some serious cash. The classy interior, food and service are all what you would expect of a Marc Forgione restaurant. I wouldn't classify this as a traditional steakhouse, as it's located in Greenwich Village and adopts a more modern, trendy image, but the steak itself will bring you right back. Don't skip the bread basket - mirroring what others have mentioned, the everything biscuits paired with vegetable compound butter are ten steps up from your regular toasted bagel in the morning. For the entree, I got the 9 oz. pastrami spiced hanger, which was incredibly flavorful and tender, and a side of fontina creamed spinach. Perfect accompaniment, perfect meal. I've been to American Cut several times over the past year and each time I was lucky enough to have had Anthony as my server. Anthony is well groomed and understands how to communicate to a customer both on a professional and personal level. He always makes the dinning experience truly exceptional and rememberable. Always pleased and grateful for his service. Moreover, the food in this establishment is phenomenal. To the homemade biscuits they start you off with to the main entrees you ordered, you're truly in for a treat and a tasteful experience. The Bone Marrow will have your taste buds in a place of wonder and awe, the Diamond Cut Jim Brady Oysters will open your eyes and palette into a new world that is unknown, yet so beautiful, and the Surf and Turf, well, is absolutely fantastic every single time! American Cut is by far my favorite steak house that I have had the privilege dining at, which I have dined at the best in New York and Long Island. If you're reading this, do me a favor and just go!  I wrote this to benefit you and to show you that American Cut is well worth everything! Enjoy and I hope you have a wonderful dining experience as I always and will have ! All the best ! Great service.Excellent sea-food tower.Excellent company.For a steak place I was, however, let down. Asked for medium ribeye. There was no pink in sight. It was a well don't piece of leather.  Red meat for me is a dietary occasion. I expect a steak house to deliver. That is all they do. The meat was simply overcooked.I would ask for medium rare next and work your way up. I am absolutely blown away by American Cut! Where to start...1. The HAPPY HOUR is amazing - $10 specialty cocktail, $5 glasses of wine, $3 beer.. in Manhattan, at a nice steak house. What?! Ps - it ends at 7:30!2. The service. I booked on Open Table and mentioned we were celebrating a birthday. We didn't tell anyone upon arrival or when we were there and our server already knew and made sure to say happy birthday upon bringing out our desert, so nice! While walking out the amazing host remembered us from 3 hours prior and wished us a happy birthday again. That's something you can't find most places.Our server was perfectly attentive and made sure we had enough time to enjoy our evening and didn't pressure us to order anything or order more drinks. 3. Decor. Amazing - chic, classy, clean, great lighting. 4. THE FOOD. Okay, let's start with the free cheesy everything biscuits that are served with a side of veggie cream cheese butter - I could eat these every day for the rest of my life. What a great alternative to the standard bread and oil. The shrimp cocktail appetizer was phenomenal, as were the twice baked potatoes with truffle. For entrees we had the filet mignon and the chili lobster. Both were out of this world good. We topped off our food babies with the Cracker Jack sundae which was amazing as well. We left with the best feeling, knowing we had gotten a great deal on drinks, ate perfectly prepared food, and had the best service. Can't wait to come back again! This is my first Restaurant ""Week""/(month) venture for me during this summer run, and I have to say it started off quite strong.  Big fan of Marc Forgione, so I've been meaning to come here.Minor gripe on the atmosphere is that we were seated downstairs, which was fine in terms of ambiance, but it was a bit warm/muggy.  Otherwise, the service was prompt, courteous and helpful (helped me settle on a dry, albeit pricey cocktail.Food-wise, as others have noted, you are started off with complimentary warm 'everything'-style biscuits with a vegetable-infused butter spread.  The biscuit was very hearty, a little dry, but with the spread...I was incredibly tempted to ask for more...but I've been working on this 'self-control' thing. For appetizers we ordered:Jim Brady Oysters - Champagne, Black Truffle, Cruccola: a decadent and tasty dish, came with 3 oysters.Bacon, Schaller & Weber - MF Steak Sauce, Black Onion: Really tasty. Nice thick (and meaty/not all gristly!) cuts of bacon with a tangy bbq dipping sauce. Awesome.For our entrees, we ordered:Pastrami-spiced Hanger Steak - As a pastrami lover, wow. Oh man, winner winner.Bell & Evans Chicken - Natural Jus, Chili: They give you a really generous portion of nice and juicy cooked chicken.  I like-a de-jus.  The jus...it make-a it tasty goood. (props if you get the snl reference)We also just got one of each of the sides offered:Sunchoke Spinach, Fontina, Smoked Salt - nicely steamed spinach; helped me feel okay about eating the steak...and everything else.Potato Puree "" Robuchon"", Local Butter - rich, creamy, what's not to like?And for dessert, we ordered the: Cracker Jack Sundae - Really fun treat, with bits of caramel popcorn and other goodies. Blueberry Bread Pudding - A little dry for bread pudding, but with the mint basil ice cream, it was quite good.Great food, good times, definite plan on being back...restaurant week and otherwise. Came here for a birthday dinner and left 5lbs heavier and satisfied  Ordered the oysters and bacon for an appetizer - bacon is a must try.For the main course I ordered the ribeye - absolutely loved the flavor but I wish the dish came out sooner as it was colder than I would've liked.For the sides we ordered the fries, creamed spinach, and the truffle Mac and cheese (not on the menu) Overall I thought the sides were OK.As for the dessert - I HAD to order the Crackerjack Sundae - I'm not even a huge fan of crackerjack popcorn but I ate every last bit of the sundae. I'd come back just for this dessert. I enjoyed the service and atmosphere here. Steaks were delicious, not terribly pricey for NYC. We brought our own bottle of Caymus for $40 cork fee. Came here for lunch to try something off the new burger bar menu. Got the ""MFC"" which is a fried chicken sandwich on an everything biscuit with chili honey and pickles. Must say for $14 it's a pretty big portion which comes with fries and completely worth every penny. Strongly recommend this sandwich. Their service was great also. 105 is the magic number. I came here for their dry aged burger at the bar, and 105 is the magic number. It took me 105 chews to finally get myself to swallow the first bite. There is absolutely no way to formulate a description of this burger other than it is 100% worth every single bit of effort to go down here. Piece by piece breakdown of my meal coming up:1) The Dry Aged Burger (14$)The burger was phenomenal. Taking the first couple bites, you sometimes chew into a crunchy little crisp bite. That is the charred dry aged steak that has been perfectly cooked and crisped to a point. The delicious layer of cheese that drapes over this magnificent patty blankets the innocent, succulent little mushrooms, cowering away from the world. This review may seem a bit awkward, but I have to say, there is no better way to describe the burger... Do yourself a favor and just go get the burger.2) The Crab Cakes (19$)Solid home styled crab cakes, coated by corn flakes, apparently an old family recipe. It definitely shows with how full the flavor is. Paired with a tangy coleslaw, the crab cake is biased on top of a delicious glazed onion puree. Excellent pair with the crispy crab cake.3) Tater Tots? (8$)Meh... Good home styled tatertots with a rich home style ketchup, but honestly, I could have done without.4) Plank Roasted Bourbon (10$ on Happy Hour)This was a nice pairing to the burger. Nice and Rich with a definite smokey residue flavor, paired really well with the crisp of the burger. If you're gonna get the burger, get the Bourbon as well, it makes it all come together oh so well.All in all, this place is definitely a place to go and would 100% recommend making the effort to come here. *** Heads up, they only make a small amount of burgers a day, so go early to catch the burger and check their Twitter at approximately 4:30 daily because that's when they tell how many burgers they have for that night. This place was absolutely delicious! My girlfriend and I arrived a bit late for our reservation but we were still seated immediately. Our server was very attentive and made great suggestions without upselling us. We had the tomahawk steak, chili lobster, aged potatoes, and the hot oysters to start. Most of our choices was based on other yelp reviews. The steak was very tender and cooked truly medium rare as expected. I'd definitely recommend coming here and trying a flambe sauce, it smelled amazing but we missed that. We went here for a friends birthday. I arrived first as the reservation was under my name. The host said my party had gotten there and led me to the table. I immediately was like umm those aren't my friends. So, eventually they figured out they had given up our table in the bar area, but let us have the bar menu in the dining room. We enjoyed a bunch of apps and burgers for dinner. Everything was delicious and my burger was so rare it barely stayed together, just how I like it. Drinks were strong and we all left happy. Yummm... loved the ambiance, the food and the service! The chili lobster is a must,  haven't had something this good in a long time! The wait staff recommend us using the sauce to dip our steak in, and they are right, i liked it much better than the steak sauce provided.  We had the porterhouse for 2, very generous portion, but the edges were a bit too charred, hence the 4 star (rather than 5). You can't leave here without trying the crackerjack sundae! Looks big, but easy to finish bc how good it is. Would def return! Great service with solid sides.

That is the charred dry aged steak that has been perfectly cooked and crisped to a point. The delicious layer of cheese that drapes over this magnificent patty blankets the innocent, succulent little mushrooms, cowering away from the world. This review may seem a bit awkward, but I have to say, there is no better way to describe the burger... Do yourself a favor and just go get the burger.2) The Crab Cakes (19$)Solid home styled crab cakes, coated by corn flakes, apparently an old family recipe. It definitely shows with how full the flavor is. Paired with a tangy coleslaw, the crab cake is biased on top of a delicious glazed onion puree. Excellent pair with the crispy crab cake.3) Tater Tots? (8$)Meh... Good home styled tatertots with a rich home style ketchup, but honestly, I could have done without.4) Plank Roasted Bourbon (10$ on Happy Hour)This was a nice pairing to the burger. Nice and Rich with a definite smokey residue flavor, paired really well with the crisp of the burger. If you're gonna get the burger, get the Bourbon as well, it makes it all come together oh so well.All in all, this place is definitely a place to go and would 100% recommend making the effort to come here. *** Heads up, they only make a small amount of burgers a day, so go early to catch the burger and check their Twitter at approximately 4:30 daily because that's when they tell how many burgers they have for that night. This place was absolutely delicious! My girlfriend and I arrived a bit late for our reservation but we were still seated immediately. Our server was very attentive and made great suggestions without upselling us. We had the tomahawk steak, chili lobster, aged potatoes, and the hot oysters to start. Most of our choices was based on other yelp reviews. The steak was very tender and cooked truly medium rare as expected. I'd definitely recommend coming here and trying a flambe sauce, it smelled amazing but we missed that. We went here for a friends birthday. I arrived first as the reservation was under my name. The host said my party had gotten there and led me to the table. I immediately was like umm those aren't my friends. So, eventually they figured out they had given up our table in the bar area, but let us have the bar menu in the dining room. We enjoyed a bunch of apps and burgers for dinner. Everything was delicious and my burger was so rare it barely stayed together, just how I like it. Drinks were strong and we all left happy. Yummm... loved the ambiance, the food and the service! The chili lobster is a must,  haven't had something this good in a long time! The wait staff recommend us using the sauce to dip our steak in, and they are right, i liked it much better than the steak sauce provided.  We had the porterhouse for 2, very generous portion, but the edges were a bit too charred, hence the 4 star (rather than 5). You can't leave here without trying the crackerjack sundae! Looks big, but easy to finish bc how good it is. Would def return! Great service with solid sides. Te sides and appetizers were very good (especially the cheese grits) and a good selection of wines by the glass. I liked the idea that you could add sides to the steak like blue cheese and foie gras, or fried egg. Although I think if you add more than 1, the flavors get muddled.Why four stars instead of 5?  It's because the flavor of the filet mignon steak was nothing special. It didn't blow me away, it tasted like your usual USDA prime steak. After a very (very) late start due to a dining partner that had the worst public transit luck possible, I had a really great experience at American Cut. We actually lost our reservation due to the aforementioned lateness, but had no problem getting a cozy table near the bar, which also served the full menu. Probably preferred that seat over the deafening roar that came from the proper dining room next door, if I'm being honest.The meal started off with some delicious everything biscuits and vegetable butter (omg so good, one of the best free bread starters I've ever had). We also split an order of half dozen oysters, which were delicious though probably overpriced, and tuna tartare, which was probably the most disappointing part of the night (decent, but I'd rather have had something else). Our main was the tomahawk steak for two, which was a rather large and impressive cut of meat. We asked for it to be cooked medium rare, and it came out more on the rare side if anything, but that didn't stop us from devouring most of it. Mushrooms and polenta made for the perfect side (I'd come here again just for this).For dessert we split the berry buckle which, while not amazing, was a nice bite to end the meal.Service was very friendly throughout, and even while I was sitting there for 60+ minutes waiting for my friend (this offset the slightly icy hostesses). Drinks were strong and smooth - the best combination - and don't be afraid to ask for something not on the menu. My friend got a very good pisco sour made for him. After a year or so of anticipating Restaurant Week at American Cut, we finally set a date to go.I'll keep it short and sweet - this is a place you want to go if you're feeling fancy or want to impress a date, all while shoveling out some serious cash. The classy interior, food and service are all what you would expect of a Marc Forgione restaurant. I wouldn't classify this as a traditional steakhouse, as it's located in Greenwich Village and adopts a more modern, trendy image, but the steak itself will bring you right back. Don't skip the bread basket - mirroring what others have mentioned, the everything biscuits paired with vegetable compound butter are ten steps up from your regular toasted bagel in the morning. For the entree, I got the 9 oz. pastrami spiced hanger, which was incredibly flavorful and tender, and a side of fontina creamed spinach. Perfect accompaniment, perfect meal. I've been to American Cut several times over the past year and each time I was lucky enough to have had Anthony as my server. Anthony is well groomed and understands how to communicate to a customer both on a professional and personal level. He always makes the dinning experience truly exceptional and rememberable. Always pleased and grateful for his service. Moreover, the food in this establishment is phenomenal. To the homemade biscuits they start you off with to the main entrees you ordered, you're truly in for a treat and a tasteful experience. The Bone Marrow will have your taste buds in a place of wonder and awe, the Diamond Cut Jim Brady Oysters will open your eyes and palette into a new world that is unknown, yet so beautiful, and the Surf and Turf, well, is absolutely fantastic every single time! American Cut is by far my favorite steak house that I have had the privilege dining at, which I have dined at the best in New York and Long Island. If you're reading this, do me a favor and just go!  I wrote this to benefit you and to show you that American Cut is well worth everything! Enjoy and I hope you have a wonderful dining experience as I always and will have ! All the best ! Great service.Excellent sea-food tower.Excellent company.For a steak place I was, however, let down. Asked for medium ribeye. There was no pink in sight. It was a well don't piece of leather.  Red meat for me is a dietary occasion. I expect a steak house to deliver. That is all they do. The meat was simply overcooked.I would ask for medium rare next and work your way up. I am absolutely blown away by American Cut! Where to start...1. The HAPPY HOUR is amazing - $10 specialty cocktail, $5 glasses of wine, $3 beer.. in Manhattan, at a nice steak house. What?! Ps - it ends at 7:30!2. The service. I booked on Open Table and mentioned we were celebrating a birthday. We didn't tell anyone upon arrival or when we were there and our server already knew and made sure to say happy birthday upon bringing out our desert, so nice! While walking out the amazing host remembered us from 3 hours prior and wished us a happy birthday again. That's something you can't find most places.Our server was perfectly attentive and made sure we had enough time to enjoy our evening and didn't pressure us to order anything or order more drinks. 3. Decor. Amazing - chic, classy, clean, great lighting. 4. THE FOOD. Okay, let's start with the free cheesy everything biscuits that are served with a side of veggie cream cheese butter - I could eat these every day for the rest of my life. What a great alternative to the standard bread and oil. The shrimp cocktail appetizer was phenomenal, as were the twice baked potatoes with truffle. For entrees we had the filet mignon and the chili lobster. Both were out of this world good. We topped off our food babies with the Cracker Jack sundae which was amazing as well. We left with the best feeling, knowing we had gotten a great deal on drinks, ate perfectly prepared food, and had the best service. Can't wait to come back again! This is my first Restaurant ""Week""/(month) venture for me during this summer run, and I have to say it started off quite strong.  Big fan of Marc Forgione, so I've been meaning to come here.Minor gripe on the atmosphere is that we were seated downstairs, which was fine in terms of ambiance, but it was a bit warm/muggy.  Otherwise, the service was prompt, courteous and helpful (helped me settle on a dry, albeit pricey cocktail.Food-wise, as others have noted, you are started off with complimentary warm 'everything'-style biscuits with a vegetable-infused butter spread.  The biscuit was very hearty, a little dry, but with the spread...I was incredibly tempted to ask for more...but I've been working on this 'self-control' thing. For appetizers we ordered:Jim Brady Oysters - Champagne, Black Truffle, Cruccola: a decadent and tasty dish, came with 3 oysters.Bacon, Schaller & Weber - MF Steak Sauce, Black Onion: Really tasty. Nice thick (and meaty/not all gristly!) cuts of bacon with a tangy bbq dipping sauce. Awesome.For our entrees, we ordered:Pastrami-spiced Hanger Steak - As a pastrami lover, wow. Oh man, winner winner.Bell & Evans Chicken - Natural Jus, Chili: They give you a really generous portion of nice and juicy cooked chicken.  I like-a de-jus.  The jus...it make-a it tasty goood. (props if you get the snl reference)We also just got one of each of the sides offered:Sunchoke Spinach, Fontina, Smoked Salt - nicely steamed spinach; helped me feel okay about eating the steak...and everything else.Potato Puree "" Robuchon"", Local Butter - rich, creamy, what's not to like?And for dessert, we ordered the: Cracker Jack Sundae - Really fun treat, with bits of caramel popcorn and other goodies. Blueberry Bread Pudding - A little dry for bread pudding, but with the mint basil ice cream, it was quite good.Great food, good times, definite plan on being back...restaurant week and otherwise. Came here for a birthday dinner and left 5lbs heavier and satisfied  Ordered the oysters and bacon for an appetizer - bacon is a must try.For the main course I ordered the ribeye - absolutely loved the flavor but I wish the dish came out sooner as it was colder than I would've liked.For the sides we ordered the fries, creamed spinach, and the truffle Mac and cheese (not on the menu) Overall I thought the sides were OK.As for the dessert - I HAD to order the Crackerjack Sundae - I'm not even a huge fan of crackerjack popcorn but I ate every last bit of the sundae. I'd come back just for this dessert. I enjoyed the service and atmosphere here. Steaks were delicious, not terribly pricey for NYC. We brought our own bottle of Caymus for $40 cork fee. Came here for lunch to try something off the new burger bar menu. Got the ""MFC"" which is a fried chicken sandwich on an everything biscuit with chili honey and pickles. Must say for $14 it's a pretty big portion which comes with fries and completely worth every penny. Strongly recommend this sandwich. Their service was great also. 105 is the magic number. I came here for their dry aged burger at the bar, and 105 is the magic number. It took me 105 chews to finally get myself to swallow the first bite.

Otherwise, the service was prompt, courteous and helpful (helped me settle on a dry, albeit pricey cocktail.Food-wise, as others have noted, you are started off with complimentary warm 'everything'-style biscuits with a vegetable-infused butter spread.  The biscuit was very hearty, a little dry, but with the spread...I was incredibly tempted to ask for more...but I've been working on this 'self-control' thing. For appetizers we ordered:Jim Brady Oysters - Champagne, Black Truffle, Cruccola: a decadent and tasty dish, came with 3 oysters.Bacon, Schaller & Weber - MF Steak Sauce, Black Onion: Really tasty. Nice thick (and meaty/not all gristly!) cuts of bacon with a tangy bbq dipping sauce. Awesome.For our entrees, we ordered:Pastrami-spiced Hanger Steak - As a pastrami lover, wow. Oh man, winner winner.Bell & Evans Chicken - Natural Jus, Chili: They give you a really generous portion of nice and juicy cooked chicken.  I like-a de-jus.  The jus...it make-a it tasty goood. (props if you get the snl reference)We also just got one of each of the sides offered:Sunchoke Spinach, Fontina, Smoked Salt - nicely steamed spinach; helped me feel okay about eating the steak...and everything else.Potato Puree "" Robuchon"", Local Butter - rich, creamy, what's not to like?And for dessert, we ordered the: Cracker Jack Sundae - Really fun treat, with bits of caramel popcorn and other goodies. Blueberry Bread Pudding - A little dry for bread pudding, but with the mint basil ice cream, it was quite good.Great food, good times, definite plan on being back...restaurant week and otherwise. Came here for a birthday dinner and left 5lbs heavier and satisfied  Ordered the oysters and bacon for an appetizer - bacon is a must try.For the main course I ordered the ribeye - absolutely loved the flavor but I wish the dish came out sooner as it was colder than I would've liked.For the sides we ordered the fries, creamed spinach, and the truffle Mac and cheese (not on the menu) Overall I thought the sides were OK.As for the dessert - I HAD to order the Crackerjack Sundae - I'm not even a huge fan of crackerjack popcorn but I ate every last bit of the sundae. I'd come back just for this dessert. I enjoyed the service and atmosphere here. Steaks were delicious, not terribly pricey for NYC. We brought our own bottle of Caymus for $40 cork fee. Came here for lunch to try something off the new burger bar menu. Got the ""MFC"" which is a fried chicken sandwich on an everything biscuit with chili honey and pickles. Must say for $14 it's a pretty big portion which comes with fries and completely worth every penny. Strongly recommend this sandwich. Their service was great also. 105 is the magic number. I came here for their dry aged burger at the bar, and 105 is the magic number. It took me 105 chews to finally get myself to swallow the first bite. There is absolutely no way to formulate a description of this burger other than it is 100% worth every single bit of effort to go down here. Piece by piece breakdown of my meal coming up:1) The Dry Aged Burger (14$)The burger was phenomenal. Taking the first couple bites, you sometimes chew into a crunchy little crisp bite. That is the charred dry aged steak that has been perfectly cooked and crisped to a point. The delicious layer of cheese that drapes over this magnificent patty blankets the innocent, succulent little mushrooms, cowering away from the world. This review may seem a bit awkward, but I have to say, there is no better way to describe the burger... Do yourself a favor and just go get the burger.2) The Crab Cakes (19$)Solid home styled crab cakes, coated by corn flakes, apparently an old family recipe. It definitely shows with how full the flavor is. Paired with a tangy coleslaw, the crab cake is biased on top of a delicious glazed onion puree. Excellent pair with the crispy crab cake.3) Tater Tots? (8$)Meh... Good home styled tatertots with a rich home style ketchup, but honestly, I could have done without.4) Plank Roasted Bourbon (10$ on Happy Hour)This was a nice pairing to the burger. Nice and Rich with a definite smokey residue flavor, paired really well with the crisp of the burger. If you're gonna get the burger, get the Bourbon as well, it makes it all come together oh so well.All in all, this place is definitely a place to go and would 100% recommend making the effort to come here. *** Heads up, they only make a small amount of burgers a day, so go early to catch the burger and check their Twitter at approximately 4:30 daily because that's when they tell how many burgers they have for that night. This place was absolutely delicious! My girlfriend and I arrived a bit late for our reservation but we were still seated immediately. Our server was very attentive and made great suggestions without upselling us. We had the tomahawk steak, chili lobster, aged potatoes, and the hot oysters to start. Most of our choices was based on other yelp reviews. The steak was very tender and cooked truly medium rare as expected. I'd definitely recommend coming here and trying a flambe sauce, it smelled amazing but we missed that. We went here for a friends birthday. I arrived first as the reservation was under my name. The host said my party had gotten there and led me to the table. I immediately was like umm those aren't my friends. So, eventually they figured out they had given up our table in the bar area, but let us have the bar menu in the dining room. We enjoyed a bunch of apps and burgers for dinner. Everything was delicious and my burger was so rare it barely stayed together, just how I like it. Drinks were strong and we all left happy. Yummm... loved the ambiance, the food and the service! The chili lobster is a must,  haven't had something this good in a long time! The wait staff recommend us using the sauce to dip our steak in, and they are right, i liked it much better than the steak sauce provided.  We had the porterhouse for 2, very generous portion, but the edges were a bit too charred, hence the 4 star (rather than 5). You can't leave here without trying the crackerjack sundae! Looks big, but easy to finish bc how good it is. Would def return! Great service with solid sides. Te sides and appetizers were very good (especially the cheese grits) and a good selection of wines by the glass. I liked the idea that you could add sides to the steak like blue cheese and foie gras, or fried egg. Although I think if you add more than 1, the flavors get muddled.Why four stars instead of 5?  It's because the flavor of the filet mignon steak was nothing special. It didn't blow me away, it tasted like your usual USDA prime steak. After a very (very) late start due to a dining partner that had the worst public transit luck possible, I had a really great experience at American Cut. We actually lost our reservation due to the aforementioned lateness, but had no problem getting a cozy table near the bar, which also served the full menu. Probably preferred that seat over the deafening roar that came from the proper dining room next door, if I'm being honest.The meal started off with some delicious everything biscuits and vegetable butter (omg so good, one of the best free bread starters I've ever had). We also split an order of half dozen oysters, which were delicious though probably overpriced, and tuna tartare, which was probably the most disappointing part of the night (decent, but I'd rather have had something else). Our main was the tomahawk steak for two, which was a rather large and impressive cut of meat. We asked for it to be cooked medium rare, and it came out more on the rare side if anything, but that didn't stop us from devouring most of it. Mushrooms and polenta made for the perfect side (I'd come here again just for this).For dessert we split the berry buckle which, while not amazing, was a nice bite to end the meal.Service was very friendly throughout, and even while I was sitting there for 60+ minutes waiting for my friend (this offset the slightly icy hostesses). Drinks were strong and smooth - the best combination - and don't be afraid to ask for something not on the menu. My friend got a very good pisco sour made for him. After a year or so of anticipating Restaurant Week at American Cut, we finally set a date to go.I'll keep it short and sweet - this is a place you want to go if you're feeling fancy or want to impress a date, all while shoveling out some serious cash. The classy interior, food and service are all what you would expect of a Marc Forgione restaurant. I wouldn't classify this as a traditional steakhouse, as it's located in Greenwich Village and adopts a more modern, trendy image, but the steak itself will bring you right back. Don't skip the bread basket - mirroring what others have mentioned, the everything biscuits paired with vegetable compound butter are ten steps up from your regular toasted bagel in the morning. For the entree, I got the 9 oz. pastrami spiced hanger, which was incredibly flavorful and tender, and a side of fontina creamed spinach. Perfect accompaniment, perfect meal. I've been to American Cut several times over the past year and each time I was lucky enough to have had Anthony as my server. Anthony is well groomed and understands how to communicate to a customer both on a professional and personal level. He always makes the dinning experience truly exceptional and rememberable. Always pleased and grateful for his service. Moreover, the food in this establishment is phenomenal. To the homemade biscuits they start you off with to the main entrees you ordered, you're truly in for a treat and a tasteful experience. The Bone Marrow will have your taste buds in a place of wonder and awe, the Diamond Cut Jim Brady Oysters will open your eyes and palette into a new world that is unknown, yet so beautiful, and the Surf and Turf, well, is absolutely fantastic every single time! American Cut is by far my favorite steak house that I have had the privilege dining at, which I have dined at the best in New York and Long Island. If you're reading this, do me a favor and just go!  I wrote this to benefit you and to show you that American Cut is well worth everything! Enjoy and I hope you have a wonderful dining experience as I always and will have ! All the best ! Great service.Excellent sea-food tower.Excellent company.For a steak place I was, however, let down. Asked for medium ribeye. There was no pink in sight. It was a well don't piece of leather.  Red meat for me is a dietary occasion. I expect a steak house to deliver. That is all they do. The meat was simply overcooked.I would ask for medium rare next and work your way up. I am absolutely blown away by American Cut! Where to start...1. The HAPPY HOUR is amazing - $10 specialty cocktail, $5 glasses of wine, $3 beer.. in Manhattan, at a nice steak house. What?! Ps - it ends at 7:30!2. The service. I booked on Open Table and mentioned we were celebrating a birthday. We didn't tell anyone upon arrival or when we were there and our server already knew and made sure to say happy birthday upon bringing out our desert, so nice! While walking out the amazing host remembered us from 3 hours prior and wished us a happy birthday again. That's something you can't find most places.Our server was perfectly attentive and made sure we had enough time to enjoy our evening and didn't pressure us to order anything or order more drinks. 3. Decor. Amazing - chic, classy, clean, great lighting. 4. THE FOOD. Okay, let's start with the free cheesy everything biscuits that are served with a side of veggie cream cheese butter - I could eat these every day for the rest of my life. What a great alternative to the standard bread and oil. The shrimp cocktail appetizer was phenomenal, as were the twice baked potatoes with truffle. For entrees we had the filet mignon and the chili lobster. Both were out of this world good. We topped off our food babies with the Cracker Jack sundae which was amazing as well. We left with the best feeling, knowing we had gotten a great deal on drinks, ate perfectly prepared food, and had the best service. Can't wait to come back again!

I've been to American Cut several times over the past year and each time I was lucky enough to have had Anthony as my server. Anthony is well groomed and understands how to communicate to a customer both on a professional and personal level. He always makes the dinning experience truly exceptional and rememberable. Always pleased and grateful for his service. Moreover, the food in this establishment is phenomenal. To the homemade biscuits they start you off with to the main entrees you ordered, you're truly in for a treat and a tasteful experience. The Bone Marrow will have your taste buds in a place of wonder and awe, the Diamond Cut Jim Brady Oysters will open your eyes and palette into a new world that is unknown, yet so beautiful, and the Surf and Turf, well, is absolutely fantastic every single time! American Cut is by far my favorite steak house that I have had the privilege dining at, which I have dined at the best in New York and Long Island. If you're reading this, do me a favor and just go!  I wrote this to benefit you and to show you that American Cut is well worth everything! Enjoy and I hope you have a wonderful dining experience as I always and will have ! All the best ! Great service.Excellent sea-food tower.Excellent company.For a steak place I was, however, let down. Asked for medium ribeye. There was no pink in sight. It was a well don't piece of leather.  Red meat for me is a dietary occasion. I expect a steak house to deliver. That is all they do. The meat was simply overcooked.I would ask for medium rare next and work your way up. I am absolutely blown away by American Cut! Where to start...1. The HAPPY HOUR is amazing - $10 specialty cocktail, $5 glasses of wine, $3 beer.. in Manhattan, at a nice steak house. What?! Ps - it ends at 7:30!2. The service. I booked on Open Table and mentioned we were celebrating a birthday. We didn't tell anyone upon arrival or when we were there and our server already knew and made sure to say happy birthday upon bringing out our desert, so nice! While walking out the amazing host remembered us from 3 hours prior and wished us a happy birthday again. That's something you can't find most places.Our server was perfectly attentive and made sure we had enough time to enjoy our evening and didn't pressure us to order anything or order more drinks. 3. Decor. Amazing - chic, classy, clean, great lighting. 4. THE FOOD. Okay, let's start with the free cheesy everything biscuits that are served with a side of veggie cream cheese butter - I could eat these every day for the rest of my life. What a great alternative to the standard bread and oil. The shrimp cocktail appetizer was phenomenal, as were the twice baked potatoes with truffle. For entrees we had the filet mignon and the chili lobster. Both were out of this world good. We topped off our food babies with the Cracker Jack sundae which was amazing as well. We left with the best feeling, knowing we had gotten a great deal on drinks, ate perfectly prepared food, and had the best service. Can't wait to come back again! This is my first Restaurant ""Week""/(month) venture for me during this summer run, and I have to say it started off quite strong.  Big fan of Marc Forgione, so I've been meaning to come here.Minor gripe on the atmosphere is that we were seated downstairs, which was fine in terms of ambiance, but it was a bit warm/muggy.  Otherwise, the service was prompt, courteous and helpful (helped me settle on a dry, albeit pricey cocktail.Food-wise, as others have noted, you are started off with complimentary warm 'everything'-style biscuits with a vegetable-infused butter spread.  The biscuit was very hearty, a little dry, but with the spread...I was incredibly tempted to ask for more...but I've been working on this 'self-control' thing. For appetizers we ordered:Jim Brady Oysters - Champagne, Black Truffle, Cruccola: a decadent and tasty dish, came with 3 oysters.Bacon, Schaller & Weber - MF Steak Sauce, Black Onion: Really tasty. Nice thick (and meaty/not all gristly!) cuts of bacon with a tangy bbq dipping sauce. Awesome.For our entrees, we ordered:Pastrami-spiced Hanger Steak - As a pastrami lover, wow. Oh man, winner winner.Bell & Evans Chicken - Natural Jus, Chili: They give you a really generous portion of nice and juicy cooked chicken.  I like-a de-jus.  The jus...it make-a it tasty goood. (props if you get the snl reference)We also just got one of each of the sides offered:Sunchoke Spinach, Fontina, Smoked Salt - nicely steamed spinach; helped me feel okay about eating the steak...and everything else.Potato Puree "" Robuchon"", Local Butter - rich, creamy, what's not to like?And for dessert, we ordered the: Cracker Jack Sundae - Really fun treat, with bits of caramel popcorn and other goodies. Blueberry Bread Pudding - A little dry for bread pudding, but with the mint basil ice cream, it was quite good.Great food, good times, definite plan on being back...restaurant week and otherwise. Came here for a birthday dinner and left 5lbs heavier and satisfied  Ordered the oysters and bacon for an appetizer - bacon is a must try.For the main course I ordered the ribeye - absolutely loved the flavor but I wish the dish came out sooner as it was colder than I would've liked.For the sides we ordered the fries, creamed spinach, and the truffle Mac and cheese (not on the menu) Overall I thought the sides were OK.As for the dessert - I HAD to order the Crackerjack Sundae - I'm not even a huge fan of crackerjack popcorn but I ate every last bit of the sundae. I'd come back just for this dessert. I enjoyed the service and atmosphere here. Steaks were delicious, not terribly pricey for NYC. We brought our own bottle of Caymus for $40 cork fee. Came here for lunch to try something off the new burger bar menu. Got the ""MFC"" which is a fried chicken sandwich on an everything biscuit with chili honey and pickles. Must say for $14 it's a pretty big portion which comes with fries and completely worth every penny. Strongly recommend this sandwich. Their service was great also. 105 is the magic number. I came here for their dry aged burger at the bar, and 105 is the magic number. It took me 105 chews to finally get myself to swallow the first bite. There is absolutely no way to formulate a description of this burger other than it is 100% worth every single bit of effort to go down here. Piece by piece breakdown of my meal coming up:1) The Dry Aged Burger (14$)The burger was phenomenal. Taking the first couple bites, you sometimes chew into a crunchy little crisp bite. That is the charred dry aged steak that has been perfectly cooked and crisped to a point. The delicious layer of cheese that drapes over this magnificent patty blankets the innocent, succulent little mushrooms, cowering away from the world. This review may seem a bit awkward, but I have to say, there is no better way to describe the burger... Do yourself a favor and just go get the burger.2) The Crab Cakes (19$)Solid home styled crab cakes, coated by corn flakes, apparently an old family recipe. It definitely shows with how full the flavor is. Paired with a tangy coleslaw, the crab cake is biased on top of a delicious glazed onion puree. Excellent pair with the crispy crab cake.3) Tater Tots? (8$)Meh... Good home styled tatertots with a rich home style ketchup, but honestly, I could have done without.4) Plank Roasted Bourbon (10$ on Happy Hour)This was a nice pairing to the burger. Nice and Rich with a definite smokey residue flavor, paired really well with the crisp of the burger. If you're gonna get the burger, get the Bourbon as well, it makes it all come together oh so well.All in all, this place is definitely a place to go and would 100% recommend making the effort to come here. *** Heads up, they only make a small amount of burgers a day, so go early to catch the burger and check their Twitter at approximately 4:30 daily because that's when they tell how many burgers they have for that night. This place was absolutely delicious! My girlfriend and I arrived a bit late for our reservation but we were still seated immediately. Our server was very attentive and made great suggestions without upselling us. We had the tomahawk steak, chili lobster, aged potatoes, and the hot oysters to start. Most of our choices was based on other yelp reviews. The steak was very tender and cooked truly medium rare as expected. I'd definitely recommend coming here and trying a flambe sauce, it smelled amazing but we missed that. We went here for a friends birthday. I arrived first as the reservation was under my name. The host said my party had gotten there and led me to the table. I immediately was like umm those aren't my friends. So, eventually they figured out they had given up our table in the bar area, but let us have the bar menu in the dining room. We enjoyed a bunch of apps and burgers for dinner. Everything was delicious and my burger was so rare it barely stayed together, just how I like it. Drinks were strong and we all left happy. Yummm... loved the ambiance, the food and the service! The chili lobster is a must,  haven't had something this good in a long time! The wait staff recommend us using the sauce to dip our steak in, and they are right, i liked it much better than the steak sauce provided.  We had the porterhouse for 2, very generous portion, but the edges were a bit too charred, hence the 4 star (rather than 5). You can't leave here without trying the crackerjack sundae! Looks big, but easy to finish bc how good it is. Would def return! Great service with solid sides. Te sides and appetizers were very good (especially the cheese grits) and a good selection of wines by the glass. I liked the idea that you could add sides to the steak like blue cheese and foie gras, or fried egg. Although I think if you add more than 1, the flavors get muddled.Why four stars instead of 5?  It's because the flavor of the filet mignon steak was nothing special. It didn't blow me away, it tasted like your usual USDA prime steak. After a very (very) late start due to a dining partner that had the worst public transit luck possible, I had a really great experience at American Cut. We actually lost our reservation due to the aforementioned lateness, but had no problem getting a cozy table near the bar, which also served the full menu. Probably preferred that seat over the deafening roar that came from the proper dining room next door, if I'm being honest.The meal started off with some delicious everything biscuits and vegetable butter (omg so good, one of the best free bread starters I've ever had). We also split an order of half dozen oysters, which were delicious though probably overpriced, and tuna tartare, which was probably the most disappointing part of the night (decent, but I'd rather have had something else). Our main was the tomahawk steak for two, which was a rather large and impressive cut of meat. We asked for it to be cooked medium rare, and it came out more on the rare side if anything, but that didn't stop us from devouring most of it. Mushrooms and polenta made for the perfect side (I'd come here again just for this).For dessert we split the berry buckle which, while not amazing, was a nice bite to end the meal.Service was very friendly throughout, and even while I was sitting there for 60+ minutes waiting for my friend (this offset the slightly icy hostesses). Drinks were strong and smooth - the best combination - and don't be afraid to ask for something not on the menu. My friend got a very good pisco sour made for him. After a year or so of anticipating Restaurant Week at American Cut, we finally set a date to go.I'll keep it short and sweet - this is a place you want to go if you're feeling fancy or want to impress a date, all while shoveling out some serious cash. The classy interior, food and service are all what you would expect of a Marc Forgione restaurant. I wouldn't classify this as a traditional steakhouse, as it's located in Greenwich Village and adopts a more modern, trendy image, but the steak itself will bring you right back. Don't skip the bread basket - mirroring what others have mentioned, the everything biscuits paired with vegetable compound butter are ten steps up from your regular toasted bagel in the morning. For the entree, I got the 9 oz. pastrami spiced hanger, which was incredibly flavorful and tender, and a side of fontina creamed spinach. Perfect accompaniment, perfect meal.

The chili lobster is a must,  haven't had something this good in a long time! The wait staff recommend us using the sauce to dip our steak in, and they are right, i liked it much better than the steak sauce provided.  We had the porterhouse for 2, very generous portion, but the edges were a bit too charred, hence the 4 star (rather than 5). You can't leave here without trying the crackerjack sundae! Looks big, but easy to finish bc how good it is. Would def return! Great service with solid sides. Te sides and appetizers were very good (especially the cheese grits) and a good selection of wines by the glass. I liked the idea that you could add sides to the steak like blue cheese and foie gras, or fried egg. Although I think if you add more than 1, the flavors get muddled.Why four stars instead of 5?  It's because the flavor of the filet mignon steak was nothing special. It didn't blow me away, it tasted like your usual USDA prime steak. After a very (very) late start due to a dining partner that had the worst public transit luck possible, I had a really great experience at American Cut. We actually lost our reservation due to the aforementioned lateness, but had no problem getting a cozy table near the bar, which also served the full menu. Probably preferred that seat over the deafening roar that came from the proper dining room next door, if I'm being honest.The meal started off with some delicious everything biscuits and vegetable butter (omg so good, one of the best free bread starters I've ever had). We also split an order of half dozen oysters, which were delicious though probably overpriced, and tuna tartare, which was probably the most disappointing part of the night (decent, but I'd rather have had something else). Our main was the tomahawk steak for two, which was a rather large and impressive cut of meat. We asked for it to be cooked medium rare, and it came out more on the rare side if anything, but that didn't stop us from devouring most of it. Mushrooms and polenta made for the perfect side (I'd come here again just for this).For dessert we split the berry buckle which, while not amazing, was a nice bite to end the meal.Service was very friendly throughout, and even while I was sitting there for 60+ minutes waiting for my friend (this offset the slightly icy hostesses). Drinks were strong and smooth - the best combination - and don't be afraid to ask for something not on the menu. My friend got a very good pisco sour made for him. After a year or so of anticipating Restaurant Week at American Cut, we finally set a date to go.I'll keep it short and sweet - this is a place you want to go if you're feeling fancy or want to impress a date, all while shoveling out some serious cash. The classy interior, food and service are all what you would expect of a Marc Forgione restaurant. I wouldn't classify this as a traditional steakhouse, as it's located in Greenwich Village and adopts a more modern, trendy image, but the steak itself will bring you right back. Don't skip the bread basket - mirroring what others have mentioned, the everything biscuits paired with vegetable compound butter are ten steps up from your regular toasted bagel in the morning. For the entree, I got the 9 oz. pastrami spiced hanger, which was incredibly flavorful and tender, and a side of fontina creamed spinach. Perfect accompaniment, perfect meal. I've been to American Cut several times over the past year and each time I was lucky enough to have had Anthony as my server. Anthony is well groomed and understands how to communicate to a customer both on a professional and personal level. He always makes the dinning experience truly exceptional and rememberable. Always pleased and grateful for his service. Moreover, the food in this establishment is phenomenal. To the homemade biscuits they start you off with to the main entrees you ordered, you're truly in for a treat and a tasteful experience. The Bone Marrow will have your taste buds in a place of wonder and awe, the Diamond Cut Jim Brady Oysters will open your eyes and palette into a new world that is unknown, yet so beautiful, and the Surf and Turf, well, is absolutely fantastic every single time! American Cut is by far my favorite steak house that I have had the privilege dining at, which I have dined at the best in New York and Long Island. If you're reading this, do me a favor and just go!  I wrote this to benefit you and to show you that American Cut is well worth everything! Enjoy and I hope you have a wonderful dining experience as I always and will have ! All the best ! Great service.Excellent sea-food tower.Excellent company.For a steak place I was, however, let down. Asked for medium ribeye. There was no pink in sight. It was a well don't piece of leather.  Red meat for me is a dietary occasion. I expect a steak house to deliver. That is all they do. The meat was simply overcooked.I would ask for medium rare next and work your way up. I am absolutely blown away by American Cut! Where to start...1. The HAPPY HOUR is amazing - $10 specialty cocktail, $5 glasses of wine, $3 beer.. in Manhattan, at a nice steak house. What?! Ps - it ends at 7:30!2. The service. I booked on Open Table and mentioned we were celebrating a birthday. We didn't tell anyone upon arrival or when we were there and our server already knew and made sure to say happy birthday upon bringing out our desert, so nice! While walking out the amazing host remembered us from 3 hours prior and wished us a happy birthday again. That's something you can't find most places.Our server was perfectly attentive and made sure we had enough time to enjoy our evening and didn't pressure us to order anything or order more drinks. 3. Decor. Amazing - chic, classy, clean, great lighting. 4. THE FOOD. Okay, let's start with the free cheesy everything biscuits that are served with a side of veggie cream cheese butter - I could eat these every day for the rest of my life. What a great alternative to the standard bread and oil. The shrimp cocktail appetizer was phenomenal, as were the twice baked potatoes with truffle. For entrees we had the filet mignon and the chili lobster. Both were out of this world good. We topped off our food babies with the Cracker Jack sundae which was amazing as well. We left with the best feeling, knowing we had gotten a great deal on drinks, ate perfectly prepared food, and had the best service. Can't wait to come back again! This is my first Restaurant ""Week""/(month) venture for me during this summer run, and I have to say it started off quite strong.  Big fan of Marc Forgione, so I've been meaning to come here.Minor gripe on the atmosphere is that we were seated downstairs, which was fine in terms of ambiance, but it was a bit warm/muggy.  Otherwise, the service was prompt, courteous and helpful (helped me settle on a dry, albeit pricey cocktail.Food-wise, as others have noted, you are started off with complimentary warm 'everything'-style biscuits with a vegetable-infused butter spread.  The biscuit was very hearty, a little dry, but with the spread...I was incredibly tempted to ask for more...but I've been working on this 'self-control' thing. For appetizers we ordered:Jim Brady Oysters - Champagne, Black Truffle, Cruccola: a decadent and tasty dish, came with 3 oysters.Bacon, Schaller & Weber - MF Steak Sauce, Black Onion: Really tasty. Nice thick (and meaty/not all gristly!) cuts of bacon with a tangy bbq dipping sauce. Awesome.For our entrees, we ordered:Pastrami-spiced Hanger Steak - As a pastrami lover, wow. Oh man, winner winner.Bell & Evans Chicken - Natural Jus, Chili: They give you a really generous portion of nice and juicy cooked chicken.  I like-a de-jus.  The jus...it make-a it tasty goood. (props if you get the snl reference)We also just got one of each of the sides offered:Sunchoke Spinach, Fontina, Smoked Salt - nicely steamed spinach; helped me feel okay about eating the steak...and everything else.Potato Puree "" Robuchon"", Local Butter - rich, creamy, what's not to like?And for dessert, we ordered the: Cracker Jack Sundae - Really fun treat, with bits of caramel popcorn and other goodies. Blueberry Bread Pudding - A little dry for bread pudding, but with the mint basil ice cream, it was quite good.Great food, good times, definite plan on being back...restaurant week and otherwise. Came here for a birthday dinner and left 5lbs heavier and satisfied  Ordered the oysters and bacon for an appetizer - bacon is a must try.For the main course I ordered the ribeye - absolutely loved the flavor but I wish the dish came out sooner as it was colder than I would've liked.For the sides we ordered the fries, creamed spinach, and the truffle Mac and cheese (not on the menu) Overall I thought the sides were OK.As for the dessert - I HAD to order the Crackerjack Sundae - I'm not even a huge fan of crackerjack popcorn but I ate every last bit of the sundae. I'd come back just for this dessert. I enjoyed the service and atmosphere here. Steaks were delicious, not terribly pricey for NYC. We brought our own bottle of Caymus for $40 cork fee. Came here for lunch to try something off the new burger bar menu. Got the ""MFC"" which is a fried chicken sandwich on an everything biscuit with chili honey and pickles. Must say for $14 it's a pretty big portion which comes with fries and completely worth every penny. Strongly recommend this sandwich. Their service was great also. 105 is the magic number. I came here for their dry aged burger at the bar, and 105 is the magic number. It took me 105 chews to finally get myself to swallow the first bite. There is absolutely no way to formulate a description of this burger other than it is 100% worth every single bit of effort to go down here. Piece by piece breakdown of my meal coming up:1) The Dry Aged Burger (14$)The burger was phenomenal. Taking the first couple bites, you sometimes chew into a crunchy little crisp bite. That is the charred dry aged steak that has been perfectly cooked and crisped to a point. The delicious layer of cheese that drapes over this magnificent patty blankets the innocent, succulent little mushrooms, cowering away from the world. This review may seem a bit awkward, but I have to say, there is no better way to describe the burger... Do yourself a favor and just go get the burger.2) The Crab Cakes (19$)Solid home styled crab cakes, coated by corn flakes, apparently an old family recipe. It definitely shows with how full the flavor is. Paired with a tangy coleslaw, the crab cake is biased on top of a delicious glazed onion puree. Excellent pair with the crispy crab cake.3) Tater Tots? (8$)Meh... Good home styled tatertots with a rich home style ketchup, but honestly, I could have done without.4) Plank Roasted Bourbon (10$ on Happy Hour)This was a nice pairing to the burger. Nice and Rich with a definite smokey residue flavor, paired really well with the crisp of the burger. If you're gonna get the burger, get the Bourbon as well, it makes it all come together oh so well.All in all, this place is definitely a place to go and would 100% recommend making the effort to come here. *** Heads up, they only make a small amount of burgers a day, so go early to catch the burger and check their Twitter at approximately 4:30 daily because that's when they tell how many burgers they have for that night. This place was absolutely delicious! My girlfriend and I arrived a bit late for our reservation but we were still seated immediately. Our server was very attentive and made great suggestions without upselling us. We had the tomahawk steak, chili lobster, aged potatoes, and the hot oysters to start. Most of our choices was based on other yelp reviews. The steak was very tender and cooked truly medium rare as expected. I'd definitely recommend coming here and trying a flambe sauce, it smelled amazing but we missed that. We went here for a friends birthday. I arrived first as the reservation was under my name. The host said my party had gotten there and led me to the table. I immediately was like umm those aren't my friends. So, eventually they figured out they had given up our table in the bar area, but let us have the bar menu in the dining room. We enjoyed a bunch of apps and burgers for dinner. Everything was delicious and my burger was so rare it barely stayed together, just how I like it. Drinks were strong and we all left happy. Yummm... loved the ambiance, the food and the service!

For the entree, I got the 9 oz. pastrami spiced hanger, which was incredibly flavorful and tender, and a side of fontina creamed spinach. Perfect accompaniment, perfect meal."," What a freaking letdown. You can see from my previous review that I had a phenomenal experience the first time I visited. Let me tell you: times have changed. Let's start with the service. My party of four was on time for our 8:00 PM reservation during Restaurant Week. It took 25 minutes for us to be seated and we barely received an apology. Not cool. Appearances from our waiter during the meal were sporadic. We also waited a full half hour between the entrees and dessert, which we ordered with the rest of our pre fixes, so it's not like we needed time to look at menus or anything.Food was fine, but not as great as last time - and it was the same exact menu, so I can make a fair comparison. The bagel-breads were still amazing. Caesar salad wasn't chopped tableside like it used to be, which is not a big deal, but that did make it special. The steak was great, as were the spinach and mashed potato sides, but my salmon was kind of hard and the chicken bordered on bland. At a restaurant of this caliber, I expect everything to be as good as the steak, though I understand that's the main event. The desserts were good, especially the bread pudding. This was sort of ruined when were given four ""petit fours"" (they were essentially mini Rice Krispies treats) with the check, and they were overly sweet and dry to the extent that I didn't even finish mine. They seemed out of place. Finally, the staff did the oddest thing with our leftovers. As a disclaimer, I don't like wasting food, and I don't care if it comes off as a tacky move to take things home during RW or at an expensive restaurant. Anyway, my friend and I both purposely moved the leftover sides (spinach etc) to our plates and asked them to wrap it all together. When we opened our containers the next day, we could see they'd scraped all of the sides out and only wrapped the leftover meat and fish. The sides weren't in a separate container - they were just gone. Who does that?TL;DR: I had a much worse experience than the first time I came, and I probably won't be back, which is a shame because the steak really is quite good. Ugh. So sad. Came here during February's restaurant week with such high expectations. Marc Forgione and his staff actually served lunch at my office building last year, and I really it enjoyed it. So, I was really looking forward to going to the restaurant in person. My partner and I each had a 3 course meal. The best part of our meals were the appetizers (octopus, salad). My partner's fish dish was okay. I got a steak (I normally love steaks), but this was subpar; it was highly salted but other than that, had no taste. Next came the desserts (crackerjack sundae, chef's selection of ice cream). My sundae had salted caramel but it was way too salty; I couldn't finish it. Somehow the sorbet/ice cream had some added salt too (we did not expect that, and was also too salty).  Overall, the meal left us very disappointed (and left us drinking water all night long). I don't know if the quality went down because of restaurant week and how busy it can get, but it was one of my worst experiences at a ""top notch"" restaurant ever. Maybe I'll give it another try during a regular day, but I'm in no hurry... Love the decor and the bloody marys. The Kobe sliders are the best on the planet but can only be ordered at the bar. Why? No clue.Take a pass on the oysters, as they're quite bland compared to blue points, and opt for the hiramasa (amberjack) tartare. It's amazing. The main issue is the steak. We ordered the ""house special"" 52 day aged porterhouse for two for - brace yourselves - $165. For that kind of dough it better be the best piece of meat, ever, and it wasn't even close. Very little marbling, quite tough to cut, actually, and without much flavor. In fact, I had to ask for steak sauce even after the custom sauce, which, while fun to watch prepare at your table, was nothing special. We were going to send it back but didn't want to embarrass the staff who were so pleased with their presentation.Still a great time but don't expect much. The decor is lovely. Servers are warm welcoming. Wine list pretty impressive except by the glass.Meat was overcooked, even though I asked for blue. Way too fresh to be served. Mash potatoes ""a la Robuchon"" is a joke. Joel should sue them !!! Wine by the glass is only 10cl AND served in a little glass jar, which means you don't even know if you get what you ordered. RUN AWAY FROM THIS PLACE 3.5 Stars- I came here for a birthday dinner during Restaurant Week, and was mostly pleased with what I had, but it didn't necessarily live up to some of the hype. Actually, when we consider that this is a steakhouse and the steak I tried was my least favorite item, that doesn't bode well. However, the appetizers and sides were pretty outstanding in flavor and cute presentation (all-clad mini pots for your sides, etc). It's a nice restaurant, so don't show up in sweats and a t-shirt. Soft, dim lighting and a great atmosphere for a nice date. Waitstaff is very attentive and very quick to address even the smallest of your concerns. And that's how it should be when you pay a decent amount for your dining experience. Restaurant Week Menus obviously means limited options, but I was able to have a nibble of everything on that menu between myself and the guest of honor. We started with their house biscuits. Think everything bagel, a bit too salty, and a creamy butter. The biscuits themselves are light, perfect texture, but again a little too salty for my personal taste and I wasn't able to finish a whole one. I had the Diamond Jim Brady Oysters for my appetizer and I enjoyed them a lot. The bacon was scrumptious, while the hanger steak was far less impressive and served without resting. I ordered the chicken, which was decent, but not that flavorful- the crispy skin is what saved them because the jus/gravy wasn't all that. The sides were the best part of this meal and worth a return trip, and probably a great deal of praise. The creamed spinach with fontina is to die for. The potato puree, I would like to have intravenously forever and ever, amen. If you haven't already figured it out, this place is not a dieter's friend- cheese in the spinach and ish. But these sides were worth every penny and I think really saved my chicken. We didn't finish the hanger steak, which I find to be pitiful in a steakhouse. Lastly, the crackerjack sundae is right on the money, but the red velvet thing we tried isn't worth the calories. Will come back for the potatoes and other sides, but skip the main dishes. Seated in the bar which was horrible...reminded me of a bowling ally! Oyster's were frozen...took forever to get entree's...very active in main dining room but we were seated in ally way between bar and kitchen...bad joke...not worth the money and that wasn't an issue!  The wait staff was actually really nice and efficient! What a freaking letdown. You can see from my previous review that I had a phenomenal experience the first time I visited. Let me tell you: times have changed. Let's start with the service. My party of four was on time for our 8:00 PM reservation during Restaurant Week. It took 25 minutes for us to be seated and we barely received an apology. Not cool. Appearances from our waiter during the meal were sporadic. We also waited a full half hour between the entrees and dessert, which we ordered with the rest of our pre fixes, so it's not like we needed time to look at menus or anything.Food was fine, but not as great as last time - and it was the same exact menu, so I can make a fair comparison. The bagel-breads were still amazing. Caesar salad wasn't chopped tableside like it used to be, which is not a big deal, but that did make it special. The steak was great, as were the spinach and mashed potato sides, but my salmon was kind of hard and the chicken bordered on bland. At a restaurant of this caliber, I expect everything to be as good as the steak, though I understand that's the main event. The desserts were good, especially the bread pudding. This was sort of ruined when were given four ""petit fours"" (they were essentially mini Rice Krispies treats) with the check, and they were overly sweet and dry to the extent that I didn't even finish mine. They seemed out of place. Finally, the staff did the oddest thing with our leftovers. As a disclaimer, I don't like wasting food, and I don't care if it comes off as a tacky move to take things home during RW or at an expensive restaurant. Anyway, my friend and I both purposely moved the leftover sides (spinach etc) to our plates and asked them to wrap it all together. When we opened our containers the next day, we could see they'd scraped all of the sides out and only wrapped the leftover meat and fish. The sides weren't in a separate container - they were just gone. Who does that?TL;DR: I had a much worse experience than the first time I came, and I probably won't be back, which is a shame because the steak really is quite good. Ugh. So sad. Came here during February's restaurant week with such high expectations. Marc Forgione and his staff actually served lunch at my office building last year, and I really it enjoyed it. So, I was really looking forward to going to the restaurant in person. My partner and I each had a 3 course meal. The best part of our meals were the appetizers (octopus, salad). My partner's fish dish was okay. I got a steak (I normally love steaks), but this was subpar; it was highly salted but other than that, had no taste. Next came the desserts (crackerjack sundae, chef's selection of ice cream). My sundae had salted caramel but it was way too salty; I couldn't finish it. Somehow the sorbet/ice cream had some added salt too (we did not expect that, and was also too salty).  Overall, the meal left us very disappointed (and left us drinking water all night long). I don't know if the quality went down because of restaurant week and how busy it can get, but it was one of my worst experiences at a ""top notch"" restaurant ever. Maybe I'll give it another try during a regular day, but I'm in no hurry... Love the decor and the bloody marys. The Kobe sliders are the best on the planet but can only be ordered at the bar. Why? No clue.Take a pass on the oysters, as they're quite bland compared to blue points, and opt for the hiramasa (amberjack) tartare. It's amazing. The main issue is the steak. We ordered the ""house special"" 52 day aged porterhouse for two for - brace yourselves - $165. For that kind of dough it better be the best piece of meat, ever, and it wasn't even close. Very little marbling, quite tough to cut, actually, and without much flavor. In fact, I had to ask for steak sauce even after the custom sauce, which, while fun to watch prepare at your table, was nothing special. We were going to send it back but didn't want to embarrass the staff who were so pleased with their presentation.Still a great time but don't expect much. The decor is lovely. Servers are warm welcoming. Wine list pretty impressive except by the glass.Meat was overcooked, even though I asked for blue. Way too fresh to be served. Mash potatoes ""a la Robuchon"" is a joke. Joel should sue them !!! Wine by the glass is only 10cl AND served in a little glass jar, which means you don't even know if you get what you ordered. RUN AWAY FROM THIS PLACE 3.5 Stars- I came here for a birthday dinner during Restaurant Week, and was mostly pleased with what I had, but it didn't necessarily live up to some of the hype. Actually, when we consider that this is a steakhouse and the steak I tried was my least favorite item, that doesn't bode well. However, the appetizers and sides were pretty outstanding in flavor and cute presentation (all-clad mini pots for your sides, etc). It's a nice restaurant, so don't show up in sweats and a t-shirt. Soft, dim lighting and a great atmosphere for a nice date. Waitstaff is very attentive and very quick to address even the smallest of your concerns. And that's how it should be when you pay a decent amount for your dining experience. Restaurant Week Menus obviously means limited options, but I was able to have a nibble of everything on that menu between myself and the guest of honor. We started with their house biscuits. Think everything bagel, a bit too salty, and a creamy butter.

Joel should sue them !!! Wine by the glass is only 10cl AND served in a little glass jar, which means you don't even know if you get what you ordered. RUN AWAY FROM THIS PLACE 3.5 Stars- I came here for a birthday dinner during Restaurant Week, and was mostly pleased with what I had, but it didn't necessarily live up to some of the hype. Actually, when we consider that this is a steakhouse and the steak I tried was my least favorite item, that doesn't bode well. However, the appetizers and sides were pretty outstanding in flavor and cute presentation (all-clad mini pots for your sides, etc). It's a nice restaurant, so don't show up in sweats and a t-shirt. Soft, dim lighting and a great atmosphere for a nice date. Waitstaff is very attentive and very quick to address even the smallest of your concerns. And that's how it should be when you pay a decent amount for your dining experience. Restaurant Week Menus obviously means limited options, but I was able to have a nibble of everything on that menu between myself and the guest of honor. We started with their house biscuits. Think everything bagel, a bit too salty, and a creamy butter. The biscuits themselves are light, perfect texture, but again a little too salty for my personal taste and I wasn't able to finish a whole one. I had the Diamond Jim Brady Oysters for my appetizer and I enjoyed them a lot. The bacon was scrumptious, while the hanger steak was far less impressive and served without resting. I ordered the chicken, which was decent, but not that flavorful- the crispy skin is what saved them because the jus/gravy wasn't all that. The sides were the best part of this meal and worth a return trip, and probably a great deal of praise. The creamed spinach with fontina is to die for. The potato puree, I would like to have intravenously forever and ever, amen. If you haven't already figured it out, this place is not a dieter's friend- cheese in the spinach and ish. But these sides were worth every penny and I think really saved my chicken. We didn't finish the hanger steak, which I find to be pitiful in a steakhouse. Lastly, the crackerjack sundae is right on the money, but the red velvet thing we tried isn't worth the calories. Will come back for the potatoes and other sides, but skip the main dishes. Seated in the bar which was horrible...reminded me of a bowling ally! Oyster's were frozen...took forever to get entree's...very active in main dining room but we were seated in ally way between bar and kitchen...bad joke...not worth the money and that wasn't an issue!  The wait staff was actually really nice and efficient! What a freaking letdown. You can see from my previous review that I had a phenomenal experience the first time I visited. Let me tell you: times have changed. Let's start with the service. My party of four was on time for our 8:00 PM reservation during Restaurant Week. It took 25 minutes for us to be seated and we barely received an apology. Not cool. Appearances from our waiter during the meal were sporadic. We also waited a full half hour between the entrees and dessert, which we ordered with the rest of our pre fixes, so it's not like we needed time to look at menus or anything.Food was fine, but not as great as last time - and it was the same exact menu, so I can make a fair comparison. The bagel-breads were still amazing. Caesar salad wasn't chopped tableside like it used to be, which is not a big deal, but that did make it special. The steak was great, as were the spinach and mashed potato sides, but my salmon was kind of hard and the chicken bordered on bland. At a restaurant of this caliber, I expect everything to be as good as the steak, though I understand that's the main event. The desserts were good, especially the bread pudding. This was sort of ruined when were given four ""petit fours"" (they were essentially mini Rice Krispies treats) with the check, and they were overly sweet and dry to the extent that I didn't even finish mine. They seemed out of place. Finally, the staff did the oddest thing with our leftovers. As a disclaimer, I don't like wasting food, and I don't care if it comes off as a tacky move to take things home during RW or at an expensive restaurant. Anyway, my friend and I both purposely moved the leftover sides (spinach etc) to our plates and asked them to wrap it all together. When we opened our containers the next day, we could see they'd scraped all of the sides out and only wrapped the leftover meat and fish. The sides weren't in a separate container - they were just gone. Who does that?TL;DR: I had a much worse experience than the first time I came, and I probably won't be back, which is a shame because the steak really is quite good. Ugh. So sad. Came here during February's restaurant week with such high expectations. Marc Forgione and his staff actually served lunch at my office building last year, and I really it enjoyed it. So, I was really looking forward to going to the restaurant in person. My partner and I each had a 3 course meal. The best part of our meals were the appetizers (octopus, salad). My partner's fish dish was okay. I got a steak (I normally love steaks), but this was subpar; it was highly salted but other than that, had no taste. Next came the desserts (crackerjack sundae, chef's selection of ice cream). My sundae had salted caramel but it was way too salty; I couldn't finish it. Somehow the sorbet/ice cream had some added salt too (we did not expect that, and was also too salty).  Overall, the meal left us very disappointed (and left us drinking water all night long). I don't know if the quality went down because of restaurant week and how busy it can get, but it was one of my worst experiences at a ""top notch"" restaurant ever. Maybe I'll give it another try during a regular day, but I'm in no hurry... Love the decor and the bloody marys. The Kobe sliders are the best on the planet but can only be ordered at the bar. Why? No clue.Take a pass on the oysters, as they're quite bland compared to blue points, and opt for the hiramasa (amberjack) tartare. It's amazing. The main issue is the steak. We ordered the ""house special"" 52 day aged porterhouse for two for - brace yourselves - $165. For that kind of dough it better be the best piece of meat, ever, and it wasn't even close. Very little marbling, quite tough to cut, actually, and without much flavor. In fact, I had to ask for steak sauce even after the custom sauce, which, while fun to watch prepare at your table, was nothing special. We were going to send it back but didn't want to embarrass the staff who were so pleased with their presentation.Still a great time but don't expect much. The decor is lovely.

I don't know if the quality went down because of restaurant week and how busy it can get, but it was one of my worst experiences at a ""top notch"" restaurant ever. Maybe I'll give it another try during a regular day, but I'm in no hurry... Love the decor and the bloody marys. The Kobe sliders are the best on the planet but can only be ordered at the bar. Why? No clue.Take a pass on the oysters, as they're quite bland compared to blue points, and opt for the hiramasa (amberjack) tartare. It's amazing. The main issue is the steak. We ordered the ""house special"" 52 day aged porterhouse for two for - brace yourselves - $165. For that kind of dough it better be the best piece of meat, ever, and it wasn't even close. Very little marbling, quite tough to cut, actually, and without much flavor. In fact, I had to ask for steak sauce even after the custom sauce, which, while fun to watch prepare at your table, was nothing special. We were going to send it back but didn't want to embarrass the staff who were so pleased with their presentation.Still a great time but don't expect much. The decor is lovely. Servers are warm welcoming. Wine list pretty impressive except by the glass.Meat was overcooked, even though I asked for blue. Way too fresh to be served. Mash potatoes ""a la Robuchon"" is a joke. Joel should sue them !!! Wine by the glass is only 10cl AND served in a little glass jar, which means you don't even know if you get what you ordered. RUN AWAY FROM THIS PLACE 3.5 Stars- I came here for a birthday dinner during Restaurant Week, and was mostly pleased with what I had, but it didn't necessarily live up to some of the hype. Actually, when we consider that this is a steakhouse and the steak I tried was my least favorite item, that doesn't bode well. However, the appetizers and sides were pretty outstanding in flavor and cute presentation (all-clad mini pots for your sides, etc). It's a nice restaurant, so don't show up in sweats and a t-shirt. Soft, dim lighting and a great atmosphere for a nice date. Waitstaff is very attentive and very quick to address even the smallest of your concerns. And that's how it should be when you pay a decent amount for your dining experience. Restaurant Week Menus obviously means limited options, but I was able to have a nibble of everything on that menu between myself and the guest of honor. We started with their house biscuits. Think everything bagel, a bit too salty, and a creamy butter. The biscuits themselves are light, perfect texture, but again a little too salty for my personal taste and I wasn't able to finish a whole one. I had the Diamond Jim Brady Oysters for my appetizer and I enjoyed them a lot. The bacon was scrumptious, while the hanger steak was far less impressive and served without resting. I ordered the chicken, which was decent, but not that flavorful- the crispy skin is what saved them because the jus/gravy wasn't all that. The sides were the best part of this meal and worth a return trip, and probably a great deal of praise. The creamed spinach with fontina is to die for. The potato puree, I would like to have intravenously forever and ever, amen. If you haven't already figured it out, this place is not a dieter's friend- cheese in the spinach and ish. But these sides were worth every penny and I think really saved my chicken. We didn't finish the hanger steak, which I find to be pitiful in a steakhouse. Lastly, the crackerjack sundae is right on the money, but the red velvet thing we tried isn't worth the calories. Will come back for the potatoes and other sides, but skip the main dishes. Seated in the bar which was horrible...reminded me of a bowling ally! Oyster's were frozen...took forever to get entree's...very active in main dining room but we were seated in ally way between bar and kitchen...bad joke...not worth the money and that wasn't an issue!  The wait staff was actually really nice and efficient! What a freaking letdown. You can see from my previous review that I had a phenomenal experience the first time I visited. Let me tell you: times have changed. Let's start with the service. My party of four was on time for our 8:00 PM reservation during Restaurant Week. It took 25 minutes for us to be seated and we barely received an apology. Not cool. Appearances from our waiter during the meal were sporadic. We also waited a full half hour between the entrees and dessert, which we ordered with the rest of our pre fixes, so it's not like we needed time to look at menus or anything.Food was fine, but not as great as last time - and it was the same exact menu, so I can make a fair comparison. The bagel-breads were still amazing. Caesar salad wasn't chopped tableside like it used to be, which is not a big deal, but that did make it special. The steak was great, as were the spinach and mashed potato sides, but my salmon was kind of hard and the chicken bordered on bland. At a restaurant of this caliber, I expect everything to be as good as the steak, though I understand that's the main event. The desserts were good, especially the bread pudding. This was sort of ruined when were given four ""petit fours"" (they were essentially mini Rice Krispies treats) with the check, and they were overly sweet and dry to the extent that I didn't even finish mine. They seemed out of place. Finally, the staff did the oddest thing with our leftovers. As a disclaimer, I don't like wasting food, and I don't care if it comes off as a tacky move to take things home during RW or at an expensive restaurant. Anyway, my friend and I both purposely moved the leftover sides (spinach etc) to our plates and asked them to wrap it all together. When we opened our containers the next day, we could see they'd scraped all of the sides out and only wrapped the leftover meat and fish. The sides weren't in a separate container - they were just gone. Who does that?TL;DR: I had a much worse experience than the first time I came, and I probably won't be back, which is a shame because the steak really is quite good. Ugh. So sad. Came here during February's restaurant week with such high expectations. Marc Forgione and his staff actually served lunch at my office building last year, and I really it enjoyed it. So, I was really looking forward to going to the restaurant in person. My partner and I each had a 3 course meal. The best part of our meals were the appetizers (octopus, salad). My partner's fish dish was okay. I got a steak (I normally love steaks), but this was subpar; it was highly salted but other than that, had no taste. Next came the desserts (crackerjack sundae, chef's selection of ice cream). My sundae had salted caramel but it was way too salty; I couldn't finish it.

Anyway, my friend and I both purposely moved the leftover sides (spinach etc) to our plates and asked them to wrap it all together. When we opened our containers the next day, we could see they'd scraped all of the sides out and only wrapped the leftover meat and fish. The sides weren't in a separate container - they were just gone. Who does that?TL;DR: I had a much worse experience than the first time I came, and I probably won't be back, which is a shame because the steak really is quite good. Ugh. So sad. Came here during February's restaurant week with such high expectations. Marc Forgione and his staff actually served lunch at my office building last year, and I really it enjoyed it. So, I was really looking forward to going to the restaurant in person. My partner and I each had a 3 course meal. The best part of our meals were the appetizers (octopus, salad). My partner's fish dish was okay. I got a steak (I normally love steaks), but this was subpar; it was highly salted but other than that, had no taste. Next came the desserts (crackerjack sundae, chef's selection of ice cream). My sundae had salted caramel but it was way too salty; I couldn't finish it. Somehow the sorbet/ice cream had some added salt too (we did not expect that, and was also too salty).  Overall, the meal left us very disappointed (and left us drinking water all night long). I don't know if the quality went down because of restaurant week and how busy it can get, but it was one of my worst experiences at a ""top notch"" restaurant ever. Maybe I'll give it another try during a regular day, but I'm in no hurry... Love the decor and the bloody marys. The Kobe sliders are the best on the planet but can only be ordered at the bar. Why? No clue.Take a pass on the oysters, as they're quite bland compared to blue points, and opt for the hiramasa (amberjack) tartare. It's amazing. The main issue is the steak. We ordered the ""house special"" 52 day aged porterhouse for two for - brace yourselves - $165. For that kind of dough it better be the best piece of meat, ever, and it wasn't even close. Very little marbling, quite tough to cut, actually, and without much flavor. In fact, I had to ask for steak sauce even after the custom sauce, which, while fun to watch prepare at your table, was nothing special. We were going to send it back but didn't want to embarrass the staff who were so pleased with their presentation.Still a great time but don't expect much. The decor is lovely. Servers are warm welcoming. Wine list pretty impressive except by the glass.Meat was overcooked, even though I asked for blue. Way too fresh to be served. Mash potatoes ""a la Robuchon"" is a joke. Joel should sue them !!! Wine by the glass is only 10cl AND served in a little glass jar, which means you don't even know if you get what you ordered. RUN AWAY FROM THIS PLACE 3.5 Stars- I came here for a birthday dinner during Restaurant Week, and was mostly pleased with what I had, but it didn't necessarily live up to some of the hype. Actually, when we consider that this is a steakhouse and the steak I tried was my least favorite item, that doesn't bode well. However, the appetizers and sides were pretty outstanding in flavor and cute presentation (all-clad mini pots for your sides, etc). It's a nice restaurant, so don't show up in sweats and a t-shirt. Soft, dim lighting and a great atmosphere for a nice date. Waitstaff is very attentive and very quick to address even the smallest of your concerns. And that's how it should be when you pay a decent amount for your dining experience. Restaurant Week Menus obviously means limited options, but I was able to have a nibble of everything on that menu between myself and the guest of honor. We started with their house biscuits. Think everything bagel, a bit too salty, and a creamy butter. The biscuits themselves are light, perfect texture, but again a little too salty for my personal taste and I wasn't able to finish a whole one. I had the Diamond Jim Brady Oysters for my appetizer and I enjoyed them a lot. The bacon was scrumptious, while the hanger steak was far less impressive and served without resting. I ordered the chicken, which was decent, but not that flavorful- the crispy skin is what saved them because the jus/gravy wasn't all that. The sides were the best part of this meal and worth a return trip, and probably a great deal of praise. The creamed spinach with fontina is to die for. The potato puree, I would like to have intravenously forever and ever, amen. If you haven't already figured it out, this place is not a dieter's friend- cheese in the spinach and ish. But these sides were worth every penny and I think really saved my chicken. We didn't finish the hanger steak, which I find to be pitiful in a steakhouse. Lastly, the crackerjack sundae is right on the money, but the red velvet thing we tried isn't worth the calories. Will come back for the potatoes and other sides, but skip the main dishes. Seated in the bar which was horrible...reminded me of a bowling ally! Oyster's were frozen...took forever to get entree's...very active in main dining room but we were seated in ally way between bar and kitchen...bad joke...not worth the money and that wasn't an issue!

4,Hakkasan -,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hakkasan-new-york?osq=Restaurants,Chinese,300.0,256.0,64.0,320.0," The winter-slurry that came about on this fateful night could not stop us from our rendezvous.  Sadly, this would be the penultimate opportunity to see her until she'd be spirited away to lands on the other side of the world.  Regret permeates the memories of the time I spent here... to have the ability to go back and kick my past self in the balls, I salivate at that opportunity; alas, the time is gone.  *Ahem* I will say though that it was not a regret to spend an evening nestled within the embrace of this establishment.  It is what some may refer to as ""high end.""  The sleek/sophisticated modern presentation is impressive, with a long tech/chic hallway with some cool dim/neon vibes lighting your way into the main vestibule.  Also included are some Asian inspired aesthetics (as this is a ""Chinese"" restaurant... despite the fact that the name sounds more Japanese, if anything else).  The NYC iteration of Hakkasan is more about the food compared to the Las Vegas version (which is more about the nightlife and the high profile DJs and the girls in the slinky dresses...).  The fare of the night will be of the Chinese variety, all expertly crafted, impeccably presented, and just tasty enough (the food tastes good, but it won't change your life... but I'm giving points to presentation, since we do ""eat"" with our eyes almost as much). After discussing the place with some Chinese friends of mine, they scoffed at the idea of turning a number of Chinese dishes into fine dining.  I will say that I ate some of the prettiest steamed and fried dim sum dishes at this place, but at the end of the day they tasted like the stuff I'd get off a cart in Chinatown... it makes sense since they are using the same ingredients (maybe of a higher quality, and by the hands of experts, but in the end all the same).  Nevertheless, if you have the money to burn, whether you just ball that way, or if you're looking to experience the place for yourself to prove me wrong, or if you mistake it for a nightclub and then end up eating there anyway, or if you're trying to impress a person with lady parts... then you could certainly do worse than this place. Inches away from my home, Hakkasan is one of the two Chinese places that I always found myself enjoying every single dish out of it (the other one being Buddakan). Lost its Michelin star last year, Hakkasan nevertheless continued to impress me from both its inside decoration and food quality.We decided to kick off with the most renown steamed dim sum platter. Instead of focusing only on the taste (like all those ordinary Chinatown spots), Hakkasan did a really good job balancing out the color inside the platter - best presentation award! The fried prawn with foie gras carefully filled in and sesame covering its crust, was tender from the inside while crispy on the outside. Pork belly was the one that indeed impressed us - not at all greasy yet preserved its nature of softness, with just the right amount of scallions and garlic to bring out the flavor. Dessert was probably one of the best things you could enjoy at Hakkasan, if not the only one. We shared the chocolate dumpling with yuzu sauce pouring inside, serving as the broth. The sweetness was perfectly balanced out by the light touch of sourness from the yuzu soup, well done!I could not believe that this was my first visit to Hakkasan NY (well I've been to its SanFran location). Guess now I have a new to-go spot in the city! Best Chinese food hands down. The large, heavy steel door of the entrance at Hakkasan lead to a whole new world of high quality Chinese food and service experience. I've always wanted to check this place out after hearing many things about it from friends, but didn't have a nice enough occasion to, and when it was my birthday, I finally had a good reason to come! Immediately upon entering, I was greeted by two friendly hostesses who lead me to my table. The restaurant has such interesting decor with dim, blue lights and chinese-inspired panels that sections off the booths and dining areas in the restaurant.In terms of what we ordered, we started off with louis roederer champagne, and ordered the steamed dimsum platter for our appetizer, and pipa duck, honey glazed sea bass, and spicy seafood fried rice for our entrees. The dim sum platter came with 4 different kinds of dim sum, all steamed to perfection.  All the different pieces were not only so pretty to look at, but also so flavorful and unique in flavor. My favorite was the har gow (white dumpling with shrimp). Next came the entrees which were all quite heavy but flavorful orders. The duck was cooked and fried(?) so well and if you wrap it in half of the flour shells with some cucumber and scallion and sauce, it's the perfect duck wrap! The seabass dish was SO tender and almost melted in my mouth. The outside was crispy and sweet while the meat of the fish was more bland so really balanced out the sauce which could be overwhelming. Lastly, the spicy seafood fried rice gave extra variety to our meal and was also very good filled with lots of seafood. We also received a plate of steamed greens which were surprisingly very delicious and paired perfectly with the heavy dishes. Sipping on champagne throughout the meal also helped keep the palate clean and not leave a greasy after taste.Since it was my birthday, the staff so wonderfully prepared dessert for me, and I got to try the yuzu desert. Not only was it so pretty to look at with the pretty spring shades of yellow and purple, but also delicious - citrus-y and very bright!I was overall very pleased with my experience at Hakkasan with the lovely waiters so attentive to my needs. I will say that they were a bit clumsy with handling the dishes and placing them on the table, but I was really excited about the food that it didn't bother me too much. I couldn't have asked for a better birthday night spent and I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who is seeking high quality Chinese dining experience for a special occasion, a place to take their parents or other important guests, or just to try something new! Stick to the small plates- Dim sum dumplings platter was a home run, duck salad was dope. Cocktails are exceptional. Read a review calling this ""Ruby Foos for the ultra-wealthy."" So they lost their Michelin star- who cares? This is not High-end so much as it is club/loungey- hence the vegas location. I defy anyone to say the food isnt beautiful and delicious. Snobs gonna hate. The food here is fantastic. Cane here with a group  so we were able to try a bunch of things, all of which were good.Food: Here is some dishes that stood out to me: the shrimp dim sum, the Seabass (still can't stop thinking about it), the salt and pepper fake chicken (best fake meat I've ever had in my life, also can't stop thinking about it), the chocolate and sesame dumplings (I've been on the hunt for chocolate dumplings ever since I won't be satisfied until I go back for more).Drinks: I have Prosecco which was great, but there's this drink here which is a smoky Grand Marnier drink, and it comes with actual smoke :-) get it.Service: Everyone was friendly, but service at our table was slow. We were with a large group so that's understandable, however, I realized that if I didn't order a drink at the time I receive my last drink, it would be a long time before I'd get a new one. So that's the approach bastard, re-ordering as soon as items came out. This is one of those fancy place like Tao. A great place to impress your date, great food and terrific service.Note to restaurant if you are reading this, please educate your staff about hoisin sauce, it does NOT contain any seafood at all. I didn't want to embarrass the waiter but he told us the hoisin sauce contains shellfish (my fiance is allergic). I don't blame him, the restaurant probably told him so. On to the food. We had the Pan-seared vegetable Shanghai dumpling, they made them very tasty even though it's just vegatables! I had the XO Wok-fry duck breast. I have to compliment the texture of the duck, it almost feel like they were beef, I love it. And the sauce was great I poured them over the fried rice we ordered. My fiance had the Mongolian style beef rib-eye. The apple and mushroom was a great side for this dish. The sauce was fantastic.We do not drink alcohol so we ordered the Virgin Hakka. Not having a sweet tooth myself, it was way too sweet for me.This is one of those people-watching restaurant, the guys at the other table keep looking at me. Piece of advice, if you are going with your date, pay attention to her! Amazing place, everything we ate and drank here was on point, along with the ambience and presentation! Worth every penny, though it was a pretty pricetag! We started with the steamed Vegetarian Dim Sum platter, then had the Vegetarian Imitation Chicken with StirFry & Brown Rice, and completed our meal with the chocolate ganache dessert, decorated with popped kernels! Very picturesque! In terms of drinks, We had the Temple of Heaven, and the Hakka signature drink which my husband still raves about! Posted some pics! Check it out! Can't wait to go back! Came here for just a drink with my friend before going to see a show. Space: very trendy. The bar lounge is huge. Probably one of the longest bars I've seen so far. They also have large full tables by the bar(which is not the main dining). I didn't get to check out the main dining space, but peeped through from the bar seat and it seemed very nice and classy. Dimly lit in there. Service: You're first greeted by the host staff. Seems very friendly. Bathroom attendant as well. Bartender is friendly and gave nice recommendations. So are the bar back staff. Everyone we came in contact with was very friendly and attentive. Excellent service. Menu: I posted the menu so everyone can have a look at what they offer. It seems very tasty. The menu had a couple more pages, but they were tasting menus. So I didn't bother posting it. Good for: dates, group gatherings, anyone who's looking for a trendy kind of fine dining in Midtown West/Hell's Kitchen area. I'd say this is a rare find in the area. Kind of feels like you stepped into the Meatpacking District. I'll def. be back for a full dining experience soon to have the dining experience. :) The dim sum awesome the ambience awesome the price over the top. This slick world wide chain restaurant delivers the goods but at a very steep price and is no surprise considering one of their establishments is located in Dubai.  Food delivery however, o-so-slow. Good fit for the west side of Manhattan and seems to pack in the tourists from Times square. Not so sure they would do as well if located in other areas of the city.  Bottom line: probably worth the price of admission once anyway to check out their dining experience and digs. Tip: go for the Hakk steamed dim sum. The food is good! Probably the best Asian fushion place I have been to. I definitely think I can say sth about Chinese food or Asian food in general. This place doesn't disappoint. All the dishes are to the point and placed gracefully in the most trending place. The dim sum platter is a must. I got tofu mushroom something, also good. It comes with egg fried rice and Bok Choy. The dessert is mango pudding, also fresh and not overly sweet. Btw I did restaurant menu, for $42, they are pretty good. Because you know most of the time, it's just a trap for restaurant week menu. Here, you can find all the dishes from their original menu and at lower price.(tasting good 70+ for similar stuff). Anyway, highly recommend. This is one fancy place with prices to match. But no worries, the food is amazing. The atmosphere is modern, sophisticated and contemporary; service is excellent, worthy of a fancy high end restaurant. The entrance is easy to miss but once in you will be wowed by nightclub like interiors.I got a virgin Hakka which was on the sweeter side, just how I like! We got the fried quail which came with rice pancakes;crispy shrimp dumpling was good too. For main course we got the vegetarian chicken with black pepper sauce (interesting concept) which tasted like chicken! The spicy prawns didn't look that great but was the best dish of the day. We ordered veg fried rice and noodles on the side as well. Chicken clay pot was flavorful too.The portion size is average.The desserts were lemon tart and salted caramel mousse. Yummy!This is a great place if you can get over the pricing. It's one to tick off the list. We had to wait for 45 minutes for a table which we had reserved but restaurant staff were very good and made it up with free cocktails. Food is amazing but pricey, service is excellent, and lady waitress was so professional and had great advice on dishes. I can see why this is so popular but you pay for it! This resturant was referred to me by my American Express travel agent and I had an opportunity to dine there recently. I am frequently in the mood for great Asian cuisine and Hakkasan did not disappoint. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the quality of the food. I experienced some really unique flavors too. The Sea Bass, which looked like a piece of Tuna when it came out, had a wonderful sweet caramelized glaze with what looked and tasted like a sear finish. While this is not how you would normally expect Sea Bass, one bite and it was clear why this is their #1 dish. The Prawns were equally tasty and were served in a unique spicy curry sauce. I was most impressed however, with their Duck! I was saving this dish for last when all of the dishes came to my table, because I love duck and have had it served in just about every way.  When my waiter saw that I had not tasted it 5 minutes into my meal she urged me to begin eating this dish before it got cold and after one bite I could easily see why. Simply WOW!  Words cannot express the overall flavorful explosion from this dish. This Duck was served in thin small one-inch pieces spread out on a plate in a rich sweet and savory brown sauce.  The meat was perfectly moist.  The skin was crackling crispy. And both parts together with that sauce was sinful. I have never tasted Duck so good in my life and this dish was so memorable, that I can't wait until I am back in The City to try it again. Service was good, not great, and for this reason I am giving a 4 star over 5. What a meal! Hubby gave me a surprise and took met here for anniversary. We didn't realize it was restaurant week. Dinner 3 course for NY restaurant week is $49 which is a great deal for this place as most dishes are around $30-40 each. One of the dishes was $228! It had caviar I think. We tried Sanpie chicken, Spicy Prawn, dim sum platter and for desserts we had sago pudding and choc/caramel special that they had on the menu(I've forgotten the name). The prawn and chicken are both high in salt and I would recommend that getting with plain rice rather than fried rice that we ordered. Having said that, the egg fried rice were absolutely delicious. Prawn is definitely recommended, the gravy was really good. Sago pudding was light and yummy. The ambience was good but we went on Monday and because of restaurant week, it was full house and very noisy. Decor is very nice. Their kitchen is the biggest I've ever seen and they have separate chefs for diff cuisines. The manager there took me for a little tour of kitchen just from outside and she told me all this. It is quite pricey though so I won't go back there unless there was a special deal on. My bougie Chinese family is all about Hakkasan. From its trendy interior to its savory dishes and sublime service, I would definitely recommend a visit. Table favorites: Crispy duck salad, Jasmine tea smoked pork ribs, Hakka pork belly claypot, Tofu aubergine and shiitake mushroom claypotHonorary mentions: Hakka steamed dim sum platter, Fried soft shell crab with curry leaf and chili Drinks: I am a fan of gin - enjoyed both the body of the Smoky Negroni, as well as the bite of the Shiso GimletDessert: loved the Pomegranate & Chocolate Bombe and the Black sesame and chocolate dumplings Enjoy! Being a Chinese myself already set a high bar for Chinese food. Hakkasan solidly surpassed my expectation.Many good drink choices on the menu. The dim sum platters (both vegetarian and regular one) are must-tries! Very delicate in presentation with high quality delicious materials. The giant prawn in spicy curry sauce is another highlight (the spicy curry sauce has a nice kick). Other dishes like Peking duck, lamb appetizer, and black cod are solid too. Lastly, the desserts are unforgettable! I absolutely enjoyed both the chocolate dumplings and the carrot cake!! Just take a look at my photos - Amazingly delicate presentation, flavorful yet not too sweet. The winter-slurry that came about on this fateful night could not stop us from our rendezvous.  Sadly, this would be the penultimate opportunity to see her until she'd be spirited away to lands on the other side of the world.

We ordered veg fried rice and noodles on the side as well. Chicken clay pot was flavorful too.The portion size is average.The desserts were lemon tart and salted caramel mousse. Yummy!This is a great place if you can get over the pricing. It's one to tick off the list. We had to wait for 45 minutes for a table which we had reserved but restaurant staff were very good and made it up with free cocktails. Food is amazing but pricey, service is excellent, and lady waitress was so professional and had great advice on dishes. I can see why this is so popular but you pay for it! This resturant was referred to me by my American Express travel agent and I had an opportunity to dine there recently. I am frequently in the mood for great Asian cuisine and Hakkasan did not disappoint. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the quality of the food. I experienced some really unique flavors too. The Sea Bass, which looked like a piece of Tuna when it came out, had a wonderful sweet caramelized glaze with what looked and tasted like a sear finish. While this is not how you would normally expect Sea Bass, one bite and it was clear why this is their #1 dish. The Prawns were equally tasty and were served in a unique spicy curry sauce. I was most impressed however, with their Duck! I was saving this dish for last when all of the dishes came to my table, because I love duck and have had it served in just about every way.  When my waiter saw that I had not tasted it 5 minutes into my meal she urged me to begin eating this dish before it got cold and after one bite I could easily see why. Simply WOW!  Words cannot express the overall flavorful explosion from this dish. This Duck was served in thin small one-inch pieces spread out on a plate in a rich sweet and savory brown sauce.  The meat was perfectly moist.  The skin was crackling crispy. And both parts together with that sauce was sinful. I have never tasted Duck so good in my life and this dish was so memorable, that I can't wait until I am back in The City to try it again. Service was good, not great, and for this reason I am giving a 4 star over 5. What a meal! Hubby gave me a surprise and took met here for anniversary. We didn't realize it was restaurant week. Dinner 3 course for NY restaurant week is $49 which is a great deal for this place as most dishes are around $30-40 each. One of the dishes was $228! It had caviar I think. We tried Sanpie chicken, Spicy Prawn, dim sum platter and for desserts we had sago pudding and choc/caramel special that they had on the menu(I've forgotten the name). The prawn and chicken are both high in salt and I would recommend that getting with plain rice rather than fried rice that we ordered. Having said that, the egg fried rice were absolutely delicious. Prawn is definitely recommended, the gravy was really good. Sago pudding was light and yummy. The ambience was good but we went on Monday and because of restaurant week, it was full house and very noisy. Decor is very nice. Their kitchen is the biggest I've ever seen and they have separate chefs for diff cuisines. The manager there took me for a little tour of kitchen just from outside and she told me all this. It is quite pricey though so I won't go back there unless there was a special deal on. My bougie Chinese family is all about Hakkasan. From its trendy interior to its savory dishes and sublime service, I would definitely recommend a visit. Table favorites: Crispy duck salad, Jasmine tea smoked pork ribs, Hakka pork belly claypot, Tofu aubergine and shiitake mushroom claypotHonorary mentions: Hakka steamed dim sum platter, Fried soft shell crab with curry leaf and chili Drinks: I am a fan of gin - enjoyed both the body of the Smoky Negroni, as well as the bite of the Shiso GimletDessert: loved the Pomegranate & Chocolate Bombe and the Black sesame and chocolate dumplings Enjoy! Being a Chinese myself already set a high bar for Chinese food. Hakkasan solidly surpassed my expectation.Many good drink choices on the menu. The dim sum platters (both vegetarian and regular one) are must-tries! Very delicate in presentation with high quality delicious materials. The giant prawn in spicy curry sauce is another highlight (the spicy curry sauce has a nice kick). Other dishes like Peking duck, lamb appetizer, and black cod are solid too. Lastly, the desserts are unforgettable! I absolutely enjoyed both the chocolate dumplings and the carrot cake!! Just take a look at my photos - Amazingly delicate presentation, flavorful yet not too sweet. The winter-slurry that came about on this fateful night could not stop us from our rendezvous.  Sadly, this would be the penultimate opportunity to see her until she'd be spirited away to lands on the other side of the world.  Regret permeates the memories of the time I spent here... to have the ability to go back and kick my past self in the balls, I salivate at that opportunity; alas, the time is gone.  *Ahem* I will say though that it was not a regret to spend an evening nestled within the embrace of this establishment.  It is what some may refer to as ""high end.""  The sleek/sophisticated modern presentation is impressive, with a long tech/chic hallway with some cool dim/neon vibes lighting your way into the main vestibule.  Also included are some Asian inspired aesthetics (as this is a ""Chinese"" restaurant... despite the fact that the name sounds more Japanese, if anything else).  The NYC iteration of Hakkasan is more about the food compared to the Las Vegas version (which is more about the nightlife and the high profile DJs and the girls in the slinky dresses...).  The fare of the night will be of the Chinese variety, all expertly crafted, impeccably presented, and just tasty enough (the food tastes good, but it won't change your life... but I'm giving points to presentation, since we do ""eat"" with our eyes almost as much). After discussing the place with some Chinese friends of mine, they scoffed at the idea of turning a number of Chinese dishes into fine dining.  I will say that I ate some of the prettiest steamed and fried dim sum dishes at this place, but at the end of the day they tasted like the stuff I'd get off a cart in Chinatown... it makes sense since they are using the same ingredients (maybe of a higher quality, and by the hands of experts, but in the end all the same).  Nevertheless, if you have the money to burn, whether you just ball that way, or if you're looking to experience the place for yourself to prove me wrong, or if you mistake it for a nightclub and then end up eating there anyway, or if you're trying to impress a person with lady parts... then you could certainly do worse than this place. Inches away from my home, Hakkasan is one of the two Chinese places that I always found myself enjoying every single dish out of it (the other one being Buddakan). Lost its Michelin star last year, Hakkasan nevertheless continued to impress me from both its inside decoration and food quality.We decided to kick off with the most renown steamed dim sum platter. Instead of focusing only on the taste (like all those ordinary Chinatown spots), Hakkasan did a really good job balancing out the color inside the platter - best presentation award! The fried prawn with foie gras carefully filled in and sesame covering its crust, was tender from the inside while crispy on the outside. Pork belly was the one that indeed impressed us - not at all greasy yet preserved its nature of softness, with just the right amount of scallions and garlic to bring out the flavor. Dessert was probably one of the best things you could enjoy at Hakkasan, if not the only one. We shared the chocolate dumpling with yuzu sauce pouring inside, serving as the broth. The sweetness was perfectly balanced out by the light touch of sourness from the yuzu soup, well done!I could not believe that this was my first visit to Hakkasan NY (well I've been to its SanFran location). Guess now I have a new to-go spot in the city! Best Chinese food hands down. The large, heavy steel door of the entrance at Hakkasan lead to a whole new world of high quality Chinese food and service experience. I've always wanted to check this place out after hearing many things about it from friends, but didn't have a nice enough occasion to, and when it was my birthday, I finally had a good reason to come! Immediately upon entering, I was greeted by two friendly hostesses who lead me to my table. The restaurant has such interesting decor with dim, blue lights and chinese-inspired panels that sections off the booths and dining areas in the restaurant.In terms of what we ordered, we started off with louis roederer champagne, and ordered the steamed dimsum platter for our appetizer, and pipa duck, honey glazed sea bass, and spicy seafood fried rice for our entrees. The dim sum platter came with 4 different kinds of dim sum, all steamed to perfection.  All the different pieces were not only so pretty to look at, but also so flavorful and unique in flavor. My favorite was the har gow (white dumpling with shrimp). Next came the entrees which were all quite heavy but flavorful orders. The duck was cooked and fried(?) so well and if you wrap it in half of the flour shells with some cucumber and scallion and sauce, it's the perfect duck wrap! The seabass dish was SO tender and almost melted in my mouth. The outside was crispy and sweet while the meat of the fish was more bland so really balanced out the sauce which could be overwhelming. Lastly, the spicy seafood fried rice gave extra variety to our meal and was also very good filled with lots of seafood. We also received a plate of steamed greens which were surprisingly very delicious and paired perfectly with the heavy dishes. Sipping on champagne throughout the meal also helped keep the palate clean and not leave a greasy after taste.Since it was my birthday, the staff so wonderfully prepared dessert for me, and I got to try the yuzu desert. Not only was it so pretty to look at with the pretty spring shades of yellow and purple, but also delicious - citrus-y and very bright!I was overall very pleased with my experience at Hakkasan with the lovely waiters so attentive to my needs. I will say that they were a bit clumsy with handling the dishes and placing them on the table, but I was really excited about the food that it didn't bother me too much. I couldn't have asked for a better birthday night spent and I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who is seeking high quality Chinese dining experience for a special occasion, a place to take their parents or other important guests, or just to try something new! Stick to the small plates- Dim sum dumplings platter was a home run, duck salad was dope. Cocktails are exceptional. Read a review calling this ""Ruby Foos for the ultra-wealthy."" So they lost their Michelin star- who cares? This is not High-end so much as it is club/loungey- hence the vegas location. I defy anyone to say the food isnt beautiful and delicious. Snobs gonna hate. The food here is fantastic. Cane here with a group  so we were able to try a bunch of things, all of which were good.Food: Here is some dishes that stood out to me: the shrimp dim sum, the Seabass (still can't stop thinking about it), the salt and pepper fake chicken (best fake meat I've ever had in my life, also can't stop thinking about it), the chocolate and sesame dumplings (I've been on the hunt for chocolate dumplings ever since I won't be satisfied until I go back for more).Drinks: I have Prosecco which was great, but there's this drink here which is a smoky Grand Marnier drink, and it comes with actual smoke :-) get it.Service: Everyone was friendly, but service at our table was slow. We were with a large group so that's understandable, however, I realized that if I didn't order a drink at the time I receive my last drink, it would be a long time before I'd get a new one. So that's the approach bastard, re-ordering as soon as items came out. This is one of those fancy place like Tao. A great place to impress your date, great food and terrific service.Note to restaurant if you are reading this, please educate your staff about hoisin sauce, it does NOT contain any seafood at all. I didn't want to embarrass the waiter but he told us the hoisin sauce contains shellfish (my fiance is allergic). I don't blame him, the restaurant probably told him so. On to the food. We had the Pan-seared vegetable Shanghai dumpling, they made them very tasty even though it's just vegatables! I had the XO Wok-fry duck breast. I have to compliment the texture of the duck, it almost feel like they were beef, I love it. And the sauce was great I poured them over the fried rice we ordered. My fiance had the Mongolian style beef rib-eye. The apple and mushroom was a great side for this dish. The sauce was fantastic.We do not drink alcohol so we ordered the Virgin Hakka. Not having a sweet tooth myself, it was way too sweet for me.This is one of those people-watching restaurant, the guys at the other table keep looking at me. Piece of advice, if you are going with your date, pay attention to her! Amazing place, everything we ate and drank here was on point, along with the ambience and presentation! Worth every penny, though it was a pretty pricetag! We started with the steamed Vegetarian Dim Sum platter, then had the Vegetarian Imitation Chicken with StirFry & Brown Rice, and completed our meal with the chocolate ganache dessert, decorated with popped kernels! Very picturesque! In terms of drinks, We had the Temple of Heaven, and the Hakka signature drink which my husband still raves about! Posted some pics! Check it out! Can't wait to go back! Came here for just a drink with my friend before going to see a show. Space: very trendy. The bar lounge is huge. Probably one of the longest bars I've seen so far. They also have large full tables by the bar(which is not the main dining). I didn't get to check out the main dining space, but peeped through from the bar seat and it seemed very nice and classy. Dimly lit in there. Service: You're first greeted by the host staff. Seems very friendly. Bathroom attendant as well. Bartender is friendly and gave nice recommendations. So are the bar back staff. Everyone we came in contact with was very friendly and attentive. Excellent service. Menu: I posted the menu so everyone can have a look at what they offer. It seems very tasty. The menu had a couple more pages, but they were tasting menus. So I didn't bother posting it. Good for: dates, group gatherings, anyone who's looking for a trendy kind of fine dining in Midtown West/Hell's Kitchen area. I'd say this is a rare find in the area. Kind of feels like you stepped into the Meatpacking District. I'll def. be back for a full dining experience soon to have the dining experience. :) The dim sum awesome the ambience awesome the price over the top. This slick world wide chain restaurant delivers the goods but at a very steep price and is no surprise considering one of their establishments is located in Dubai.  Food delivery however, o-so-slow. Good fit for the west side of Manhattan and seems to pack in the tourists from Times square. Not so sure they would do as well if located in other areas of the city.  Bottom line: probably worth the price of admission once anyway to check out their dining experience and digs. Tip: go for the Hakk steamed dim sum. The food is good! Probably the best Asian fushion place I have been to. I definitely think I can say sth about Chinese food or Asian food in general. This place doesn't disappoint. All the dishes are to the point and placed gracefully in the most trending place. The dim sum platter is a must. I got tofu mushroom something, also good. It comes with egg fried rice and Bok Choy. The dessert is mango pudding, also fresh and not overly sweet. Btw I did restaurant menu, for $42, they are pretty good. Because you know most of the time, it's just a trap for restaurant week menu. Here, you can find all the dishes from their original menu and at lower price.(tasting good 70+ for similar stuff). Anyway, highly recommend. This is one fancy place with prices to match. But no worries, the food is amazing. The atmosphere is modern, sophisticated and contemporary; service is excellent, worthy of a fancy high end restaurant. The entrance is easy to miss but once in you will be wowed by nightclub like interiors.I got a virgin Hakka which was on the sweeter side, just how I like! We got the fried quail which came with rice pancakes;crispy shrimp dumpling was good too. For main course we got the vegetarian chicken with black pepper sauce (interesting concept) which tasted like chicken! The spicy prawns didn't look that great but was the best dish of the day.

Words cannot express the overall flavorful explosion from this dish. This Duck was served in thin small one-inch pieces spread out on a plate in a rich sweet and savory brown sauce.  The meat was perfectly moist.  The skin was crackling crispy. And both parts together with that sauce was sinful. I have never tasted Duck so good in my life and this dish was so memorable, that I can't wait until I am back in The City to try it again. Service was good, not great, and for this reason I am giving a 4 star over 5. What a meal! Hubby gave me a surprise and took met here for anniversary. We didn't realize it was restaurant week. Dinner 3 course for NY restaurant week is $49 which is a great deal for this place as most dishes are around $30-40 each. One of the dishes was $228! It had caviar I think. We tried Sanpie chicken, Spicy Prawn, dim sum platter and for desserts we had sago pudding and choc/caramel special that they had on the menu(I've forgotten the name). The prawn and chicken are both high in salt and I would recommend that getting with plain rice rather than fried rice that we ordered. Having said that, the egg fried rice were absolutely delicious. Prawn is definitely recommended, the gravy was really good. Sago pudding was light and yummy. The ambience was good but we went on Monday and because of restaurant week, it was full house and very noisy. Decor is very nice. Their kitchen is the biggest I've ever seen and they have separate chefs for diff cuisines. The manager there took me for a little tour of kitchen just from outside and she told me all this. It is quite pricey though so I won't go back there unless there was a special deal on. My bougie Chinese family is all about Hakkasan. From its trendy interior to its savory dishes and sublime service, I would definitely recommend a visit. Table favorites: Crispy duck salad, Jasmine tea smoked pork ribs, Hakka pork belly claypot, Tofu aubergine and shiitake mushroom claypotHonorary mentions: Hakka steamed dim sum platter, Fried soft shell crab with curry leaf and chili Drinks: I am a fan of gin - enjoyed both the body of the Smoky Negroni, as well as the bite of the Shiso GimletDessert: loved the Pomegranate & Chocolate Bombe and the Black sesame and chocolate dumplings Enjoy! Being a Chinese myself already set a high bar for Chinese food. Hakkasan solidly surpassed my expectation.Many good drink choices on the menu. The dim sum platters (both vegetarian and regular one) are must-tries! Very delicate in presentation with high quality delicious materials. The giant prawn in spicy curry sauce is another highlight (the spicy curry sauce has a nice kick). Other dishes like Peking duck, lamb appetizer, and black cod are solid too. Lastly, the desserts are unforgettable! I absolutely enjoyed both the chocolate dumplings and the carrot cake!! Just take a look at my photos - Amazingly delicate presentation, flavorful yet not too sweet. The winter-slurry that came about on this fateful night could not stop us from our rendezvous.  Sadly, this would be the penultimate opportunity to see her until she'd be spirited away to lands on the other side of the world.  Regret permeates the memories of the time I spent here... to have the ability to go back and kick my past self in the balls, I salivate at that opportunity; alas, the time is gone.  *Ahem* I will say though that it was not a regret to spend an evening nestled within the embrace of this establishment.  It is what some may refer to as ""high end.""  The sleek/sophisticated modern presentation is impressive, with a long tech/chic hallway with some cool dim/neon vibes lighting your way into the main vestibule.  Also included are some Asian inspired aesthetics (as this is a ""Chinese"" restaurant... despite the fact that the name sounds more Japanese, if anything else).  The NYC iteration of Hakkasan is more about the food compared to the Las Vegas version (which is more about the nightlife and the high profile DJs and the girls in the slinky dresses...).  The fare of the night will be of the Chinese variety, all expertly crafted, impeccably presented, and just tasty enough (the food tastes good, but it won't change your life... but I'm giving points to presentation, since we do ""eat"" with our eyes almost as much). After discussing the place with some Chinese friends of mine, they scoffed at the idea of turning a number of Chinese dishes into fine dining.  I will say that I ate some of the prettiest steamed and fried dim sum dishes at this place, but at the end of the day they tasted like the stuff I'd get off a cart in Chinatown... it makes sense since they are using the same ingredients (maybe of a higher quality, and by the hands of experts, but in the end all the same).  Nevertheless, if you have the money to burn, whether you just ball that way, or if you're looking to experience the place for yourself to prove me wrong, or if you mistake it for a nightclub and then end up eating there anyway, or if you're trying to impress a person with lady parts... then you could certainly do worse than this place. Inches away from my home, Hakkasan is one of the two Chinese places that I always found myself enjoying every single dish out of it (the other one being Buddakan). Lost its Michelin star last year, Hakkasan nevertheless continued to impress me from both its inside decoration and food quality.We decided to kick off with the most renown steamed dim sum platter. Instead of focusing only on the taste (like all those ordinary Chinatown spots), Hakkasan did a really good job balancing out the color inside the platter - best presentation award! The fried prawn with foie gras carefully filled in and sesame covering its crust, was tender from the inside while crispy on the outside. Pork belly was the one that indeed impressed us - not at all greasy yet preserved its nature of softness, with just the right amount of scallions and garlic to bring out the flavor. Dessert was probably one of the best things you could enjoy at Hakkasan, if not the only one. We shared the chocolate dumpling with yuzu sauce pouring inside, serving as the broth. The sweetness was perfectly balanced out by the light touch of sourness from the yuzu soup, well done!I could not believe that this was my first visit to Hakkasan NY (well I've been to its SanFran location). Guess now I have a new to-go spot in the city! Best Chinese food hands down. The large, heavy steel door of the entrance at Hakkasan lead to a whole new world of high quality Chinese food and service experience. I've always wanted to check this place out after hearing many things about it from friends, but didn't have a nice enough occasion to, and when it was my birthday, I finally had a good reason to come! Immediately upon entering, I was greeted by two friendly hostesses who lead me to my table. The restaurant has such interesting decor with dim, blue lights and chinese-inspired panels that sections off the booths and dining areas in the restaurant.In terms of what we ordered, we started off with louis roederer champagne, and ordered the steamed dimsum platter for our appetizer, and pipa duck, honey glazed sea bass, and spicy seafood fried rice for our entrees. The dim sum platter came with 4 different kinds of dim sum, all steamed to perfection.  All the different pieces were not only so pretty to look at, but also so flavorful and unique in flavor. My favorite was the har gow (white dumpling with shrimp). Next came the entrees which were all quite heavy but flavorful orders. The duck was cooked and fried(?) so well and if you wrap it in half of the flour shells with some cucumber and scallion and sauce, it's the perfect duck wrap! The seabass dish was SO tender and almost melted in my mouth. The outside was crispy and sweet while the meat of the fish was more bland so really balanced out the sauce which could be overwhelming. Lastly, the spicy seafood fried rice gave extra variety to our meal and was also very good filled with lots of seafood. We also received a plate of steamed greens which were surprisingly very delicious and paired perfectly with the heavy dishes. Sipping on champagne throughout the meal also helped keep the palate clean and not leave a greasy after taste.Since it was my birthday, the staff so wonderfully prepared dessert for me, and I got to try the yuzu desert. Not only was it so pretty to look at with the pretty spring shades of yellow and purple, but also delicious - citrus-y and very bright!I was overall very pleased with my experience at Hakkasan with the lovely waiters so attentive to my needs. I will say that they were a bit clumsy with handling the dishes and placing them on the table, but I was really excited about the food that it didn't bother me too much. I couldn't have asked for a better birthday night spent and I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who is seeking high quality Chinese dining experience for a special occasion, a place to take their parents or other important guests, or just to try something new! Stick to the small plates- Dim sum dumplings platter was a home run, duck salad was dope. Cocktails are exceptional. Read a review calling this ""Ruby Foos for the ultra-wealthy."" So they lost their Michelin star- who cares? This is not High-end so much as it is club/loungey- hence the vegas location. I defy anyone to say the food isnt beautiful and delicious. Snobs gonna hate. The food here is fantastic. Cane here with a group  so we were able to try a bunch of things, all of which were good.Food: Here is some dishes that stood out to me: the shrimp dim sum, the Seabass (still can't stop thinking about it), the salt and pepper fake chicken (best fake meat I've ever had in my life, also can't stop thinking about it), the chocolate and sesame dumplings (I've been on the hunt for chocolate dumplings ever since I won't be satisfied until I go back for more).Drinks: I have Prosecco which was great, but there's this drink here which is a smoky Grand Marnier drink, and it comes with actual smoke :-) get it.Service: Everyone was friendly, but service at our table was slow. We were with a large group so that's understandable, however, I realized that if I didn't order a drink at the time I receive my last drink, it would be a long time before I'd get a new one. So that's the approach bastard, re-ordering as soon as items came out. This is one of those fancy place like Tao. A great place to impress your date, great food and terrific service.Note to restaurant if you are reading this, please educate your staff about hoisin sauce, it does NOT contain any seafood at all. I didn't want to embarrass the waiter but he told us the hoisin sauce contains shellfish (my fiance is allergic). I don't blame him, the restaurant probably told him so. On to the food. We had the Pan-seared vegetable Shanghai dumpling, they made them very tasty even though it's just vegatables! I had the XO Wok-fry duck breast. I have to compliment the texture of the duck, it almost feel like they were beef, I love it. And the sauce was great I poured them over the fried rice we ordered. My fiance had the Mongolian style beef rib-eye. The apple and mushroom was a great side for this dish. The sauce was fantastic.We do not drink alcohol so we ordered the Virgin Hakka. Not having a sweet tooth myself, it was way too sweet for me.This is one of those people-watching restaurant, the guys at the other table keep looking at me. Piece of advice, if you are going with your date, pay attention to her! Amazing place, everything we ate and drank here was on point, along with the ambience and presentation! Worth every penny, though it was a pretty pricetag! We started with the steamed Vegetarian Dim Sum platter, then had the Vegetarian Imitation Chicken with StirFry & Brown Rice, and completed our meal with the chocolate ganache dessert, decorated with popped kernels! Very picturesque! In terms of drinks, We had the Temple of Heaven, and the Hakka signature drink which my husband still raves about! Posted some pics! Check it out! Can't wait to go back! Came here for just a drink with my friend before going to see a show. Space: very trendy. The bar lounge is huge. Probably one of the longest bars I've seen so far. They also have large full tables by the bar(which is not the main dining). I didn't get to check out the main dining space, but peeped through from the bar seat and it seemed very nice and classy. Dimly lit in there. Service: You're first greeted by the host staff. Seems very friendly. Bathroom attendant as well. Bartender is friendly and gave nice recommendations. So are the bar back staff. Everyone we came in contact with was very friendly and attentive. Excellent service. Menu: I posted the menu so everyone can have a look at what they offer. It seems very tasty. The menu had a couple more pages, but they were tasting menus. So I didn't bother posting it. Good for: dates, group gatherings, anyone who's looking for a trendy kind of fine dining in Midtown West/Hell's Kitchen area. I'd say this is a rare find in the area. Kind of feels like you stepped into the Meatpacking District. I'll def. be back for a full dining experience soon to have the dining experience. :) The dim sum awesome the ambience awesome the price over the top. This slick world wide chain restaurant delivers the goods but at a very steep price and is no surprise considering one of their establishments is located in Dubai.  Food delivery however, o-so-slow. Good fit for the west side of Manhattan and seems to pack in the tourists from Times square. Not so sure they would do as well if located in other areas of the city.  Bottom line: probably worth the price of admission once anyway to check out their dining experience and digs. Tip: go for the Hakk steamed dim sum. The food is good! Probably the best Asian fushion place I have been to. I definitely think I can say sth about Chinese food or Asian food in general. This place doesn't disappoint. All the dishes are to the point and placed gracefully in the most trending place. The dim sum platter is a must. I got tofu mushroom something, also good. It comes with egg fried rice and Bok Choy. The dessert is mango pudding, also fresh and not overly sweet. Btw I did restaurant menu, for $42, they are pretty good. Because you know most of the time, it's just a trap for restaurant week menu. Here, you can find all the dishes from their original menu and at lower price.(tasting good 70+ for similar stuff). Anyway, highly recommend. This is one fancy place with prices to match. But no worries, the food is amazing. The atmosphere is modern, sophisticated and contemporary; service is excellent, worthy of a fancy high end restaurant. The entrance is easy to miss but once in you will be wowed by nightclub like interiors.I got a virgin Hakka which was on the sweeter side, just how I like! We got the fried quail which came with rice pancakes;crispy shrimp dumpling was good too. For main course we got the vegetarian chicken with black pepper sauce (interesting concept) which tasted like chicken! The spicy prawns didn't look that great but was the best dish of the day. We ordered veg fried rice and noodles on the side as well. Chicken clay pot was flavorful too.The portion size is average.The desserts were lemon tart and salted caramel mousse. Yummy!This is a great place if you can get over the pricing. It's one to tick off the list. We had to wait for 45 minutes for a table which we had reserved but restaurant staff were very good and made it up with free cocktails. Food is amazing but pricey, service is excellent, and lady waitress was so professional and had great advice on dishes. I can see why this is so popular but you pay for it! This resturant was referred to me by my American Express travel agent and I had an opportunity to dine there recently. I am frequently in the mood for great Asian cuisine and Hakkasan did not disappoint. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the quality of the food. I experienced some really unique flavors too. The Sea Bass, which looked like a piece of Tuna when it came out, had a wonderful sweet caramelized glaze with what looked and tasted like a sear finish. While this is not how you would normally expect Sea Bass, one bite and it was clear why this is their #1 dish. The Prawns were equally tasty and were served in a unique spicy curry sauce. I was most impressed however, with their Duck! I was saving this dish for last when all of the dishes came to my table, because I love duck and have had it served in just about every way.

Their kitchen is the biggest I've ever seen and they have separate chefs for diff cuisines. The manager there took me for a little tour of kitchen just from outside and she told me all this. It is quite pricey though so I won't go back there unless there was a special deal on. My bougie Chinese family is all about Hakkasan. From its trendy interior to its savory dishes and sublime service, I would definitely recommend a visit. Table favorites: Crispy duck salad, Jasmine tea smoked pork ribs, Hakka pork belly claypot, Tofu aubergine and shiitake mushroom claypotHonorary mentions: Hakka steamed dim sum platter, Fried soft shell crab with curry leaf and chili Drinks: I am a fan of gin - enjoyed both the body of the Smoky Negroni, as well as the bite of the Shiso GimletDessert: loved the Pomegranate & Chocolate Bombe and the Black sesame and chocolate dumplings Enjoy! Being a Chinese myself already set a high bar for Chinese food. Hakkasan solidly surpassed my expectation.Many good drink choices on the menu. The dim sum platters (both vegetarian and regular one) are must-tries! Very delicate in presentation with high quality delicious materials. The giant prawn in spicy curry sauce is another highlight (the spicy curry sauce has a nice kick). Other dishes like Peking duck, lamb appetizer, and black cod are solid too. Lastly, the desserts are unforgettable! I absolutely enjoyed both the chocolate dumplings and the carrot cake!! Just take a look at my photos - Amazingly delicate presentation, flavorful yet not too sweet. The winter-slurry that came about on this fateful night could not stop us from our rendezvous.  Sadly, this would be the penultimate opportunity to see her until she'd be spirited away to lands on the other side of the world.  Regret permeates the memories of the time I spent here... to have the ability to go back and kick my past self in the balls, I salivate at that opportunity; alas, the time is gone.  *Ahem* I will say though that it was not a regret to spend an evening nestled within the embrace of this establishment.  It is what some may refer to as ""high end.""  The sleek/sophisticated modern presentation is impressive, with a long tech/chic hallway with some cool dim/neon vibes lighting your way into the main vestibule.  Also included are some Asian inspired aesthetics (as this is a ""Chinese"" restaurant... despite the fact that the name sounds more Japanese, if anything else).  The NYC iteration of Hakkasan is more about the food compared to the Las Vegas version (which is more about the nightlife and the high profile DJs and the girls in the slinky dresses...).  The fare of the night will be of the Chinese variety, all expertly crafted, impeccably presented, and just tasty enough (the food tastes good, but it won't change your life... but I'm giving points to presentation, since we do ""eat"" with our eyes almost as much). After discussing the place with some Chinese friends of mine, they scoffed at the idea of turning a number of Chinese dishes into fine dining.  I will say that I ate some of the prettiest steamed and fried dim sum dishes at this place, but at the end of the day they tasted like the stuff I'd get off a cart in Chinatown... it makes sense since they are using the same ingredients (maybe of a higher quality, and by the hands of experts, but in the end all the same).  Nevertheless, if you have the money to burn, whether you just ball that way, or if you're looking to experience the place for yourself to prove me wrong, or if you mistake it for a nightclub and then end up eating there anyway, or if you're trying to impress a person with lady parts... then you could certainly do worse than this place. Inches away from my home, Hakkasan is one of the two Chinese places that I always found myself enjoying every single dish out of it (the other one being Buddakan). Lost its Michelin star last year, Hakkasan nevertheless continued to impress me from both its inside decoration and food quality.We decided to kick off with the most renown steamed dim sum platter. Instead of focusing only on the taste (like all those ordinary Chinatown spots), Hakkasan did a really good job balancing out the color inside the platter - best presentation award! The fried prawn with foie gras carefully filled in and sesame covering its crust, was tender from the inside while crispy on the outside. Pork belly was the one that indeed impressed us - not at all greasy yet preserved its nature of softness, with just the right amount of scallions and garlic to bring out the flavor. Dessert was probably one of the best things you could enjoy at Hakkasan, if not the only one. We shared the chocolate dumpling with yuzu sauce pouring inside, serving as the broth. The sweetness was perfectly balanced out by the light touch of sourness from the yuzu soup, well done!I could not believe that this was my first visit to Hakkasan NY (well I've been to its SanFran location). Guess now I have a new to-go spot in the city! Best Chinese food hands down. The large, heavy steel door of the entrance at Hakkasan lead to a whole new world of high quality Chinese food and service experience. I've always wanted to check this place out after hearing many things about it from friends, but didn't have a nice enough occasion to, and when it was my birthday, I finally had a good reason to come! Immediately upon entering, I was greeted by two friendly hostesses who lead me to my table. The restaurant has such interesting decor with dim, blue lights and chinese-inspired panels that sections off the booths and dining areas in the restaurant.In terms of what we ordered, we started off with louis roederer champagne, and ordered the steamed dimsum platter for our appetizer, and pipa duck, honey glazed sea bass, and spicy seafood fried rice for our entrees. The dim sum platter came with 4 different kinds of dim sum, all steamed to perfection.  All the different pieces were not only so pretty to look at, but also so flavorful and unique in flavor. My favorite was the har gow (white dumpling with shrimp). Next came the entrees which were all quite heavy but flavorful orders. The duck was cooked and fried(?) so well and if you wrap it in half of the flour shells with some cucumber and scallion and sauce, it's the perfect duck wrap! The seabass dish was SO tender and almost melted in my mouth. The outside was crispy and sweet while the meat of the fish was more bland so really balanced out the sauce which could be overwhelming. Lastly, the spicy seafood fried rice gave extra variety to our meal and was also very good filled with lots of seafood. We also received a plate of steamed greens which were surprisingly very delicious and paired perfectly with the heavy dishes. Sipping on champagne throughout the meal also helped keep the palate clean and not leave a greasy after taste.Since it was my birthday, the staff so wonderfully prepared dessert for me, and I got to try the yuzu desert. Not only was it so pretty to look at with the pretty spring shades of yellow and purple, but also delicious - citrus-y and very bright!I was overall very pleased with my experience at Hakkasan with the lovely waiters so attentive to my needs. I will say that they were a bit clumsy with handling the dishes and placing them on the table, but I was really excited about the food that it didn't bother me too much. I couldn't have asked for a better birthday night spent and I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who is seeking high quality Chinese dining experience for a special occasion, a place to take their parents or other important guests, or just to try something new! Stick to the small plates- Dim sum dumplings platter was a home run, duck salad was dope. Cocktails are exceptional. Read a review calling this ""Ruby Foos for the ultra-wealthy."" So they lost their Michelin star- who cares? This is not High-end so much as it is club/loungey- hence the vegas location. I defy anyone to say the food isnt beautiful and delicious. Snobs gonna hate. The food here is fantastic. Cane here with a group  so we were able to try a bunch of things, all of which were good.Food: Here is some dishes that stood out to me: the shrimp dim sum, the Seabass (still can't stop thinking about it), the salt and pepper fake chicken (best fake meat I've ever had in my life, also can't stop thinking about it), the chocolate and sesame dumplings (I've been on the hunt for chocolate dumplings ever since I won't be satisfied until I go back for more).Drinks: I have Prosecco which was great, but there's this drink here which is a smoky Grand Marnier drink, and it comes with actual smoke :-) get it.Service: Everyone was friendly, but service at our table was slow. We were with a large group so that's understandable, however, I realized that if I didn't order a drink at the time I receive my last drink, it would be a long time before I'd get a new one. So that's the approach bastard, re-ordering as soon as items came out. This is one of those fancy place like Tao. A great place to impress your date, great food and terrific service.Note to restaurant if you are reading this, please educate your staff about hoisin sauce, it does NOT contain any seafood at all. I didn't want to embarrass the waiter but he told us the hoisin sauce contains shellfish (my fiance is allergic). I don't blame him, the restaurant probably told him so. On to the food. We had the Pan-seared vegetable Shanghai dumpling, they made them very tasty even though it's just vegatables! I had the XO Wok-fry duck breast. I have to compliment the texture of the duck, it almost feel like they were beef, I love it. And the sauce was great I poured them over the fried rice we ordered. My fiance had the Mongolian style beef rib-eye. The apple and mushroom was a great side for this dish. The sauce was fantastic.We do not drink alcohol so we ordered the Virgin Hakka. Not having a sweet tooth myself, it was way too sweet for me.This is one of those people-watching restaurant, the guys at the other table keep looking at me. Piece of advice, if you are going with your date, pay attention to her! Amazing place, everything we ate and drank here was on point, along with the ambience and presentation! Worth every penny, though it was a pretty pricetag! We started with the steamed Vegetarian Dim Sum platter, then had the Vegetarian Imitation Chicken with StirFry & Brown Rice, and completed our meal with the chocolate ganache dessert, decorated with popped kernels! Very picturesque! In terms of drinks, We had the Temple of Heaven, and the Hakka signature drink which my husband still raves about! Posted some pics! Check it out! Can't wait to go back! Came here for just a drink with my friend before going to see a show. Space: very trendy. The bar lounge is huge. Probably one of the longest bars I've seen so far. They also have large full tables by the bar(which is not the main dining). I didn't get to check out the main dining space, but peeped through from the bar seat and it seemed very nice and classy. Dimly lit in there. Service: You're first greeted by the host staff. Seems very friendly. Bathroom attendant as well. Bartender is friendly and gave nice recommendations. So are the bar back staff. Everyone we came in contact with was very friendly and attentive. Excellent service. Menu: I posted the menu so everyone can have a look at what they offer. It seems very tasty. The menu had a couple more pages, but they were tasting menus. So I didn't bother posting it. Good for: dates, group gatherings, anyone who's looking for a trendy kind of fine dining in Midtown West/Hell's Kitchen area. I'd say this is a rare find in the area. Kind of feels like you stepped into the Meatpacking District. I'll def. be back for a full dining experience soon to have the dining experience. :) The dim sum awesome the ambience awesome the price over the top. This slick world wide chain restaurant delivers the goods but at a very steep price and is no surprise considering one of their establishments is located in Dubai.  Food delivery however, o-so-slow. Good fit for the west side of Manhattan and seems to pack in the tourists from Times square. Not so sure they would do as well if located in other areas of the city.  Bottom line: probably worth the price of admission once anyway to check out their dining experience and digs. Tip: go for the Hakk steamed dim sum. The food is good! Probably the best Asian fushion place I have been to. I definitely think I can say sth about Chinese food or Asian food in general. This place doesn't disappoint. All the dishes are to the point and placed gracefully in the most trending place. The dim sum platter is a must. I got tofu mushroom something, also good. It comes with egg fried rice and Bok Choy. The dessert is mango pudding, also fresh and not overly sweet. Btw I did restaurant menu, for $42, they are pretty good. Because you know most of the time, it's just a trap for restaurant week menu. Here, you can find all the dishes from their original menu and at lower price.(tasting good 70+ for similar stuff). Anyway, highly recommend. This is one fancy place with prices to match. But no worries, the food is amazing. The atmosphere is modern, sophisticated and contemporary; service is excellent, worthy of a fancy high end restaurant. The entrance is easy to miss but once in you will be wowed by nightclub like interiors.I got a virgin Hakka which was on the sweeter side, just how I like! We got the fried quail which came with rice pancakes;crispy shrimp dumpling was good too. For main course we got the vegetarian chicken with black pepper sauce (interesting concept) which tasted like chicken! The spicy prawns didn't look that great but was the best dish of the day. We ordered veg fried rice and noodles on the side as well. Chicken clay pot was flavorful too.The portion size is average.The desserts were lemon tart and salted caramel mousse. Yummy!This is a great place if you can get over the pricing. It's one to tick off the list. We had to wait for 45 minutes for a table which we had reserved but restaurant staff were very good and made it up with free cocktails. Food is amazing but pricey, service is excellent, and lady waitress was so professional and had great advice on dishes. I can see why this is so popular but you pay for it! This resturant was referred to me by my American Express travel agent and I had an opportunity to dine there recently. I am frequently in the mood for great Asian cuisine and Hakkasan did not disappoint. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the quality of the food. I experienced some really unique flavors too. The Sea Bass, which looked like a piece of Tuna when it came out, had a wonderful sweet caramelized glaze with what looked and tasted like a sear finish. While this is not how you would normally expect Sea Bass, one bite and it was clear why this is their #1 dish. The Prawns were equally tasty and were served in a unique spicy curry sauce. I was most impressed however, with their Duck! I was saving this dish for last when all of the dishes came to my table, because I love duck and have had it served in just about every way.  When my waiter saw that I had not tasted it 5 minutes into my meal she urged me to begin eating this dish before it got cold and after one bite I could easily see why. Simply WOW!  Words cannot express the overall flavorful explosion from this dish. This Duck was served in thin small one-inch pieces spread out on a plate in a rich sweet and savory brown sauce.  The meat was perfectly moist.  The skin was crackling crispy. And both parts together with that sauce was sinful. I have never tasted Duck so good in my life and this dish was so memorable, that I can't wait until I am back in The City to try it again. Service was good, not great, and for this reason I am giving a 4 star over 5. What a meal! Hubby gave me a surprise and took met here for anniversary. We didn't realize it was restaurant week. Dinner 3 course for NY restaurant week is $49 which is a great deal for this place as most dishes are around $30-40 each. One of the dishes was $228! It had caviar I think. We tried Sanpie chicken, Spicy Prawn, dim sum platter and for desserts we had sago pudding and choc/caramel special that they had on the menu(I've forgotten the name). The prawn and chicken are both high in salt and I would recommend that getting with plain rice rather than fried rice that we ordered. Having said that, the egg fried rice were absolutely delicious. Prawn is definitely recommended, the gravy was really good. Sago pudding was light and yummy. The ambience was good but we went on Monday and because of restaurant week, it was full house and very noisy. Decor is very nice. Their kitchen is the biggest I've ever seen and they have separate chefs for diff cuisines. The manager there took me for a little tour of kitchen just from outside and she told me all this.

Regret permeates the memories of the time I spent here... to have the ability to go back and kick my past self in the balls, I salivate at that opportunity; alas, the time is gone.  *Ahem* I will say though that it was not a regret to spend an evening nestled within the embrace of this establishment.  It is what some may refer to as ""high end.""  The sleek/sophisticated modern presentation is impressive, with a long tech/chic hallway with some cool dim/neon vibes lighting your way into the main vestibule.  Also included are some Asian inspired aesthetics (as this is a ""Chinese"" restaurant... despite the fact that the name sounds more Japanese, if anything else).  The NYC iteration of Hakkasan is more about the food compared to the Las Vegas version (which is more about the nightlife and the high profile DJs and the girls in the slinky dresses...).  The fare of the night will be of the Chinese variety, all expertly crafted, impeccably presented, and just tasty enough (the food tastes good, but it won't change your life... but I'm giving points to presentation, since we do ""eat"" with our eyes almost as much). After discussing the place with some Chinese friends of mine, they scoffed at the idea of turning a number of Chinese dishes into fine dining.  I will say that I ate some of the prettiest steamed and fried dim sum dishes at this place, but at the end of the day they tasted like the stuff I'd get off a cart in Chinatown... it makes sense since they are using the same ingredients (maybe of a higher quality, and by the hands of experts, but in the end all the same).  Nevertheless, if you have the money to burn, whether you just ball that way, or if you're looking to experience the place for yourself to prove me wrong, or if you mistake it for a nightclub and then end up eating there anyway, or if you're trying to impress a person with lady parts... then you could certainly do worse than this place. Inches away from my home, Hakkasan is one of the two Chinese places that I always found myself enjoying every single dish out of it (the other one being Buddakan). Lost its Michelin star last year, Hakkasan nevertheless continued to impress me from both its inside decoration and food quality.We decided to kick off with the most renown steamed dim sum platter. Instead of focusing only on the taste (like all those ordinary Chinatown spots), Hakkasan did a really good job balancing out the color inside the platter - best presentation award! The fried prawn with foie gras carefully filled in and sesame covering its crust, was tender from the inside while crispy on the outside. Pork belly was the one that indeed impressed us - not at all greasy yet preserved its nature of softness, with just the right amount of scallions and garlic to bring out the flavor. Dessert was probably one of the best things you could enjoy at Hakkasan, if not the only one. We shared the chocolate dumpling with yuzu sauce pouring inside, serving as the broth. The sweetness was perfectly balanced out by the light touch of sourness from the yuzu soup, well done!I could not believe that this was my first visit to Hakkasan NY (well I've been to its SanFran location). Guess now I have a new to-go spot in the city! Best Chinese food hands down. The large, heavy steel door of the entrance at Hakkasan lead to a whole new world of high quality Chinese food and service experience. I've always wanted to check this place out after hearing many things about it from friends, but didn't have a nice enough occasion to, and when it was my birthday, I finally had a good reason to come! Immediately upon entering, I was greeted by two friendly hostesses who lead me to my table. The restaurant has such interesting decor with dim, blue lights and chinese-inspired panels that sections off the booths and dining areas in the restaurant.In terms of what we ordered, we started off with louis roederer champagne, and ordered the steamed dimsum platter for our appetizer, and pipa duck, honey glazed sea bass, and spicy seafood fried rice for our entrees. The dim sum platter came with 4 different kinds of dim sum, all steamed to perfection.  All the different pieces were not only so pretty to look at, but also so flavorful and unique in flavor. My favorite was the har gow (white dumpling with shrimp). Next came the entrees which were all quite heavy but flavorful orders. The duck was cooked and fried(?) so well and if you wrap it in half of the flour shells with some cucumber and scallion and sauce, it's the perfect duck wrap! The seabass dish was SO tender and almost melted in my mouth. The outside was crispy and sweet while the meat of the fish was more bland so really balanced out the sauce which could be overwhelming. Lastly, the spicy seafood fried rice gave extra variety to our meal and was also very good filled with lots of seafood. We also received a plate of steamed greens which were surprisingly very delicious and paired perfectly with the heavy dishes. Sipping on champagne throughout the meal also helped keep the palate clean and not leave a greasy after taste.Since it was my birthday, the staff so wonderfully prepared dessert for me, and I got to try the yuzu desert. Not only was it so pretty to look at with the pretty spring shades of yellow and purple, but also delicious - citrus-y and very bright!I was overall very pleased with my experience at Hakkasan with the lovely waiters so attentive to my needs. I will say that they were a bit clumsy with handling the dishes and placing them on the table, but I was really excited about the food that it didn't bother me too much. I couldn't have asked for a better birthday night spent and I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who is seeking high quality Chinese dining experience for a special occasion, a place to take their parents or other important guests, or just to try something new! Stick to the small plates- Dim sum dumplings platter was a home run, duck salad was dope. Cocktails are exceptional. Read a review calling this ""Ruby Foos for the ultra-wealthy."" So they lost their Michelin star- who cares? This is not High-end so much as it is club/loungey- hence the vegas location. I defy anyone to say the food isnt beautiful and delicious. Snobs gonna hate. The food here is fantastic. Cane here with a group  so we were able to try a bunch of things, all of which were good.Food: Here is some dishes that stood out to me: the shrimp dim sum, the Seabass (still can't stop thinking about it), the salt and pepper fake chicken (best fake meat I've ever had in my life, also can't stop thinking about it), the chocolate and sesame dumplings (I've been on the hunt for chocolate dumplings ever since I won't be satisfied until I go back for more).Drinks: I have Prosecco which was great, but there's this drink here which is a smoky Grand Marnier drink, and it comes with actual smoke :-) get it.Service: Everyone was friendly, but service at our table was slow. We were with a large group so that's understandable, however, I realized that if I didn't order a drink at the time I receive my last drink, it would be a long time before I'd get a new one. So that's the approach bastard, re-ordering as soon as items came out. This is one of those fancy place like Tao. A great place to impress your date, great food and terrific service.Note to restaurant if you are reading this, please educate your staff about hoisin sauce, it does NOT contain any seafood at all. I didn't want to embarrass the waiter but he told us the hoisin sauce contains shellfish (my fiance is allergic). I don't blame him, the restaurant probably told him so. On to the food. We had the Pan-seared vegetable Shanghai dumpling, they made them very tasty even though it's just vegatables! I had the XO Wok-fry duck breast. I have to compliment the texture of the duck, it almost feel like they were beef, I love it. And the sauce was great I poured them over the fried rice we ordered. My fiance had the Mongolian style beef rib-eye. The apple and mushroom was a great side for this dish. The sauce was fantastic.We do not drink alcohol so we ordered the Virgin Hakka. Not having a sweet tooth myself, it was way too sweet for me.This is one of those people-watching restaurant, the guys at the other table keep looking at me. Piece of advice, if you are going with your date, pay attention to her! Amazing place, everything we ate and drank here was on point, along with the ambience and presentation! Worth every penny, though it was a pretty pricetag! We started with the steamed Vegetarian Dim Sum platter, then had the Vegetarian Imitation Chicken with StirFry & Brown Rice, and completed our meal with the chocolate ganache dessert, decorated with popped kernels! Very picturesque! In terms of drinks, We had the Temple of Heaven, and the Hakka signature drink which my husband still raves about! Posted some pics! Check it out! Can't wait to go back! Came here for just a drink with my friend before going to see a show. Space: very trendy. The bar lounge is huge. Probably one of the longest bars I've seen so far. They also have large full tables by the bar(which is not the main dining). I didn't get to check out the main dining space, but peeped through from the bar seat and it seemed very nice and classy. Dimly lit in there. Service: You're first greeted by the host staff. Seems very friendly. Bathroom attendant as well. Bartender is friendly and gave nice recommendations. So are the bar back staff. Everyone we came in contact with was very friendly and attentive. Excellent service. Menu: I posted the menu so everyone can have a look at what they offer. It seems very tasty. The menu had a couple more pages, but they were tasting menus. So I didn't bother posting it. Good for: dates, group gatherings, anyone who's looking for a trendy kind of fine dining in Midtown West/Hell's Kitchen area. I'd say this is a rare find in the area. Kind of feels like you stepped into the Meatpacking District. I'll def. be back for a full dining experience soon to have the dining experience. :) The dim sum awesome the ambience awesome the price over the top. This slick world wide chain restaurant delivers the goods but at a very steep price and is no surprise considering one of their establishments is located in Dubai.  Food delivery however, o-so-slow. Good fit for the west side of Manhattan and seems to pack in the tourists from Times square. Not so sure they would do as well if located in other areas of the city.  Bottom line: probably worth the price of admission once anyway to check out their dining experience and digs. Tip: go for the Hakk steamed dim sum. The food is good! Probably the best Asian fushion place I have been to. I definitely think I can say sth about Chinese food or Asian food in general. This place doesn't disappoint. All the dishes are to the point and placed gracefully in the most trending place. The dim sum platter is a must. I got tofu mushroom something, also good. It comes with egg fried rice and Bok Choy. The dessert is mango pudding, also fresh and not overly sweet. Btw I did restaurant menu, for $42, they are pretty good. Because you know most of the time, it's just a trap for restaurant week menu. Here, you can find all the dishes from their original menu and at lower price.(tasting good 70+ for similar stuff). Anyway, highly recommend. This is one fancy place with prices to match. But no worries, the food is amazing. The atmosphere is modern, sophisticated and contemporary; service is excellent, worthy of a fancy high end restaurant. The entrance is easy to miss but once in you will be wowed by nightclub like interiors.I got a virgin Hakka which was on the sweeter side, just how I like! We got the fried quail which came with rice pancakes;crispy shrimp dumpling was good too. For main course we got the vegetarian chicken with black pepper sauce (interesting concept) which tasted like chicken! The spicy prawns didn't look that great but was the best dish of the day. We ordered veg fried rice and noodles on the side as well. Chicken clay pot was flavorful too.The portion size is average.The desserts were lemon tart and salted caramel mousse. Yummy!This is a great place if you can get over the pricing. It's one to tick off the list. We had to wait for 45 minutes for a table which we had reserved but restaurant staff were very good and made it up with free cocktails. Food is amazing but pricey, service is excellent, and lady waitress was so professional and had great advice on dishes. I can see why this is so popular but you pay for it! This resturant was referred to me by my American Express travel agent and I had an opportunity to dine there recently. I am frequently in the mood for great Asian cuisine and Hakkasan did not disappoint. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the quality of the food. I experienced some really unique flavors too. The Sea Bass, which looked like a piece of Tuna when it came out, had a wonderful sweet caramelized glaze with what looked and tasted like a sear finish. While this is not how you would normally expect Sea Bass, one bite and it was clear why this is their #1 dish. The Prawns were equally tasty and were served in a unique spicy curry sauce. I was most impressed however, with their Duck! I was saving this dish for last when all of the dishes came to my table, because I love duck and have had it served in just about every way.  When my waiter saw that I had not tasted it 5 minutes into my meal she urged me to begin eating this dish before it got cold and after one bite I could easily see why. Simply WOW!  Words cannot express the overall flavorful explosion from this dish. This Duck was served in thin small one-inch pieces spread out on a plate in a rich sweet and savory brown sauce.  The meat was perfectly moist.  The skin was crackling crispy. And both parts together with that sauce was sinful. I have never tasted Duck so good in my life and this dish was so memorable, that I can't wait until I am back in The City to try it again. Service was good, not great, and for this reason I am giving a 4 star over 5. What a meal! Hubby gave me a surprise and took met here for anniversary. We didn't realize it was restaurant week. Dinner 3 course for NY restaurant week is $49 which is a great deal for this place as most dishes are around $30-40 each. One of the dishes was $228! It had caviar I think. We tried Sanpie chicken, Spicy Prawn, dim sum platter and for desserts we had sago pudding and choc/caramel special that they had on the menu(I've forgotten the name). The prawn and chicken are both high in salt and I would recommend that getting with plain rice rather than fried rice that we ordered. Having said that, the egg fried rice were absolutely delicious. Prawn is definitely recommended, the gravy was really good. Sago pudding was light and yummy. The ambience was good but we went on Monday and because of restaurant week, it was full house and very noisy. Decor is very nice. Their kitchen is the biggest I've ever seen and they have separate chefs for diff cuisines. The manager there took me for a little tour of kitchen just from outside and she told me all this. It is quite pricey though so I won't go back there unless there was a special deal on. My bougie Chinese family is all about Hakkasan. From its trendy interior to its savory dishes and sublime service, I would definitely recommend a visit. Table favorites: Crispy duck salad, Jasmine tea smoked pork ribs, Hakka pork belly claypot, Tofu aubergine and shiitake mushroom claypotHonorary mentions: Hakka steamed dim sum platter, Fried soft shell crab with curry leaf and chili Drinks: I am a fan of gin - enjoyed both the body of the Smoky Negroni, as well as the bite of the Shiso GimletDessert: loved the Pomegranate & Chocolate Bombe and the Black sesame and chocolate dumplings Enjoy! Being a Chinese myself already set a high bar for Chinese food. Hakkasan solidly surpassed my expectation.Many good drink choices on the menu. The dim sum platters (both vegetarian and regular one) are must-tries! Very delicate in presentation with high quality delicious materials. The giant prawn in spicy curry sauce is another highlight (the spicy curry sauce has a nice kick). Other dishes like Peking duck, lamb appetizer, and black cod are solid too. Lastly, the desserts are unforgettable! I absolutely enjoyed both the chocolate dumplings and the carrot cake!! Just take a look at my photos - Amazingly delicate presentation, flavorful yet not too sweet. The winter-slurry that came about on this fateful night could not stop us from our rendezvous.

Nevertheless, if you have the money to burn, whether you just ball that way, or if you're looking to experience the place for yourself to prove me wrong, or if you mistake it for a nightclub and then end up eating there anyway, or if you're trying to impress a person with lady parts... then you could certainly do worse than this place. Inches away from my home, Hakkasan is one of the two Chinese places that I always found myself enjoying every single dish out of it (the other one being Buddakan). Lost its Michelin star last year, Hakkasan nevertheless continued to impress me from both its inside decoration and food quality.We decided to kick off with the most renown steamed dim sum platter. Instead of focusing only on the taste (like all those ordinary Chinatown spots), Hakkasan did a really good job balancing out the color inside the platter - best presentation award! The fried prawn with foie gras carefully filled in and sesame covering its crust, was tender from the inside while crispy on the outside. Pork belly was the one that indeed impressed us - not at all greasy yet preserved its nature of softness, with just the right amount of scallions and garlic to bring out the flavor. Dessert was probably one of the best things you could enjoy at Hakkasan, if not the only one. We shared the chocolate dumpling with yuzu sauce pouring inside, serving as the broth. The sweetness was perfectly balanced out by the light touch of sourness from the yuzu soup, well done!I could not believe that this was my first visit to Hakkasan NY (well I've been to its SanFran location). Guess now I have a new to-go spot in the city! Best Chinese food hands down. The large, heavy steel door of the entrance at Hakkasan lead to a whole new world of high quality Chinese food and service experience. I've always wanted to check this place out after hearing many things about it from friends, but didn't have a nice enough occasion to, and when it was my birthday, I finally had a good reason to come! Immediately upon entering, I was greeted by two friendly hostesses who lead me to my table. The restaurant has such interesting decor with dim, blue lights and chinese-inspired panels that sections off the booths and dining areas in the restaurant.In terms of what we ordered, we started off with louis roederer champagne, and ordered the steamed dimsum platter for our appetizer, and pipa duck, honey glazed sea bass, and spicy seafood fried rice for our entrees. The dim sum platter came with 4 different kinds of dim sum, all steamed to perfection.  All the different pieces were not only so pretty to look at, but also so flavorful and unique in flavor. My favorite was the har gow (white dumpling with shrimp). Next came the entrees which were all quite heavy but flavorful orders. The duck was cooked and fried(?) so well and if you wrap it in half of the flour shells with some cucumber and scallion and sauce, it's the perfect duck wrap! The seabass dish was SO tender and almost melted in my mouth. The outside was crispy and sweet while the meat of the fish was more bland so really balanced out the sauce which could be overwhelming. Lastly, the spicy seafood fried rice gave extra variety to our meal and was also very good filled with lots of seafood. We also received a plate of steamed greens which were surprisingly very delicious and paired perfectly with the heavy dishes. Sipping on champagne throughout the meal also helped keep the palate clean and not leave a greasy after taste.Since it was my birthday, the staff so wonderfully prepared dessert for me, and I got to try the yuzu desert. Not only was it so pretty to look at with the pretty spring shades of yellow and purple, but also delicious - citrus-y and very bright!I was overall very pleased with my experience at Hakkasan with the lovely waiters so attentive to my needs. I will say that they were a bit clumsy with handling the dishes and placing them on the table, but I was really excited about the food that it didn't bother me too much. I couldn't have asked for a better birthday night spent and I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who is seeking high quality Chinese dining experience for a special occasion, a place to take their parents or other important guests, or just to try something new! Stick to the small plates- Dim sum dumplings platter was a home run, duck salad was dope. Cocktails are exceptional. Read a review calling this ""Ruby Foos for the ultra-wealthy."" So they lost their Michelin star- who cares? This is not High-end so much as it is club/loungey- hence the vegas location. I defy anyone to say the food isnt beautiful and delicious. Snobs gonna hate. The food here is fantastic. Cane here with a group  so we were able to try a bunch of things, all of which were good.Food: Here is some dishes that stood out to me: the shrimp dim sum, the Seabass (still can't stop thinking about it), the salt and pepper fake chicken (best fake meat I've ever had in my life, also can't stop thinking about it), the chocolate and sesame dumplings (I've been on the hunt for chocolate dumplings ever since I won't be satisfied until I go back for more).Drinks: I have Prosecco which was great, but there's this drink here which is a smoky Grand Marnier drink, and it comes with actual smoke :-) get it.Service: Everyone was friendly, but service at our table was slow. We were with a large group so that's understandable, however, I realized that if I didn't order a drink at the time I receive my last drink, it would be a long time before I'd get a new one. So that's the approach bastard, re-ordering as soon as items came out. This is one of those fancy place like Tao. A great place to impress your date, great food and terrific service.Note to restaurant if you are reading this, please educate your staff about hoisin sauce, it does NOT contain any seafood at all. I didn't want to embarrass the waiter but he told us the hoisin sauce contains shellfish (my fiance is allergic). I don't blame him, the restaurant probably told him so. On to the food. We had the Pan-seared vegetable Shanghai dumpling, they made them very tasty even though it's just vegatables! I had the XO Wok-fry duck breast. I have to compliment the texture of the duck, it almost feel like they were beef, I love it. And the sauce was great I poured them over the fried rice we ordered. My fiance had the Mongolian style beef rib-eye. The apple and mushroom was a great side for this dish. The sauce was fantastic.We do not drink alcohol so we ordered the Virgin Hakka. Not having a sweet tooth myself, it was way too sweet for me.This is one of those people-watching restaurant, the guys at the other table keep looking at me. Piece of advice, if you are going with your date, pay attention to her! Amazing place, everything we ate and drank here was on point, along with the ambience and presentation! Worth every penny, though it was a pretty pricetag! We started with the steamed Vegetarian Dim Sum platter, then had the Vegetarian Imitation Chicken with StirFry & Brown Rice, and completed our meal with the chocolate ganache dessert, decorated with popped kernels! Very picturesque! In terms of drinks, We had the Temple of Heaven, and the Hakka signature drink which my husband still raves about! Posted some pics! Check it out! Can't wait to go back! Came here for just a drink with my friend before going to see a show. Space: very trendy. The bar lounge is huge. Probably one of the longest bars I've seen so far. They also have large full tables by the bar(which is not the main dining). I didn't get to check out the main dining space, but peeped through from the bar seat and it seemed very nice and classy. Dimly lit in there. Service: You're first greeted by the host staff. Seems very friendly. Bathroom attendant as well. Bartender is friendly and gave nice recommendations. So are the bar back staff. Everyone we came in contact with was very friendly and attentive. Excellent service. Menu: I posted the menu so everyone can have a look at what they offer. It seems very tasty. The menu had a couple more pages, but they were tasting menus. So I didn't bother posting it. Good for: dates, group gatherings, anyone who's looking for a trendy kind of fine dining in Midtown West/Hell's Kitchen area. I'd say this is a rare find in the area. Kind of feels like you stepped into the Meatpacking District. I'll def. be back for a full dining experience soon to have the dining experience. :) The dim sum awesome the ambience awesome the price over the top. This slick world wide chain restaurant delivers the goods but at a very steep price and is no surprise considering one of their establishments is located in Dubai.  Food delivery however, o-so-slow. Good fit for the west side of Manhattan and seems to pack in the tourists from Times square. Not so sure they would do as well if located in other areas of the city.  Bottom line: probably worth the price of admission once anyway to check out their dining experience and digs. Tip: go for the Hakk steamed dim sum. The food is good! Probably the best Asian fushion place I have been to. I definitely think I can say sth about Chinese food or Asian food in general. This place doesn't disappoint. All the dishes are to the point and placed gracefully in the most trending place. The dim sum platter is a must. I got tofu mushroom something, also good. It comes with egg fried rice and Bok Choy. The dessert is mango pudding, also fresh and not overly sweet. Btw I did restaurant menu, for $42, they are pretty good. Because you know most of the time, it's just a trap for restaurant week menu. Here, you can find all the dishes from their original menu and at lower price.(tasting good 70+ for similar stuff). Anyway, highly recommend. This is one fancy place with prices to match. But no worries, the food is amazing. The atmosphere is modern, sophisticated and contemporary; service is excellent, worthy of a fancy high end restaurant. The entrance is easy to miss but once in you will be wowed by nightclub like interiors.I got a virgin Hakka which was on the sweeter side, just how I like! We got the fried quail which came with rice pancakes;crispy shrimp dumpling was good too. For main course we got the vegetarian chicken with black pepper sauce (interesting concept) which tasted like chicken! The spicy prawns didn't look that great but was the best dish of the day. We ordered veg fried rice and noodles on the side as well. Chicken clay pot was flavorful too.The portion size is average.The desserts were lemon tart and salted caramel mousse. Yummy!This is a great place if you can get over the pricing. It's one to tick off the list. We had to wait for 45 minutes for a table which we had reserved but restaurant staff were very good and made it up with free cocktails. Food is amazing but pricey, service is excellent, and lady waitress was so professional and had great advice on dishes. I can see why this is so popular but you pay for it! This resturant was referred to me by my American Express travel agent and I had an opportunity to dine there recently. I am frequently in the mood for great Asian cuisine and Hakkasan did not disappoint. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the quality of the food. I experienced some really unique flavors too. The Sea Bass, which looked like a piece of Tuna when it came out, had a wonderful sweet caramelized glaze with what looked and tasted like a sear finish. While this is not how you would normally expect Sea Bass, one bite and it was clear why this is their #1 dish. The Prawns were equally tasty and were served in a unique spicy curry sauce. I was most impressed however, with their Duck! I was saving this dish for last when all of the dishes came to my table, because I love duck and have had it served in just about every way.  When my waiter saw that I had not tasted it 5 minutes into my meal she urged me to begin eating this dish before it got cold and after one bite I could easily see why. Simply WOW!  Words cannot express the overall flavorful explosion from this dish. This Duck was served in thin small one-inch pieces spread out on a plate in a rich sweet and savory brown sauce.  The meat was perfectly moist.  The skin was crackling crispy. And both parts together with that sauce was sinful. I have never tasted Duck so good in my life and this dish was so memorable, that I can't wait until I am back in The City to try it again. Service was good, not great, and for this reason I am giving a 4 star over 5. What a meal! Hubby gave me a surprise and took met here for anniversary. We didn't realize it was restaurant week. Dinner 3 course for NY restaurant week is $49 which is a great deal for this place as most dishes are around $30-40 each. One of the dishes was $228! It had caviar I think. We tried Sanpie chicken, Spicy Prawn, dim sum platter and for desserts we had sago pudding and choc/caramel special that they had on the menu(I've forgotten the name). The prawn and chicken are both high in salt and I would recommend that getting with plain rice rather than fried rice that we ordered. Having said that, the egg fried rice were absolutely delicious. Prawn is definitely recommended, the gravy was really good. Sago pudding was light and yummy. The ambience was good but we went on Monday and because of restaurant week, it was full house and very noisy. Decor is very nice. Their kitchen is the biggest I've ever seen and they have separate chefs for diff cuisines. The manager there took me for a little tour of kitchen just from outside and she told me all this. It is quite pricey though so I won't go back there unless there was a special deal on. My bougie Chinese family is all about Hakkasan. From its trendy interior to its savory dishes and sublime service, I would definitely recommend a visit. Table favorites: Crispy duck salad, Jasmine tea smoked pork ribs, Hakka pork belly claypot, Tofu aubergine and shiitake mushroom claypotHonorary mentions: Hakka steamed dim sum platter, Fried soft shell crab with curry leaf and chili Drinks: I am a fan of gin - enjoyed both the body of the Smoky Negroni, as well as the bite of the Shiso GimletDessert: loved the Pomegranate & Chocolate Bombe and the Black sesame and chocolate dumplings Enjoy! Being a Chinese myself already set a high bar for Chinese food. Hakkasan solidly surpassed my expectation.Many good drink choices on the menu. The dim sum platters (both vegetarian and regular one) are must-tries! Very delicate in presentation with high quality delicious materials. The giant prawn in spicy curry sauce is another highlight (the spicy curry sauce has a nice kick). Other dishes like Peking duck, lamb appetizer, and black cod are solid too. Lastly, the desserts are unforgettable! I absolutely enjoyed both the chocolate dumplings and the carrot cake!! Just take a look at my photos - Amazingly delicate presentation, flavorful yet not too sweet. The winter-slurry that came about on this fateful night could not stop us from our rendezvous.  Sadly, this would be the penultimate opportunity to see her until she'd be spirited away to lands on the other side of the world.  Regret permeates the memories of the time I spent here... to have the ability to go back and kick my past self in the balls, I salivate at that opportunity; alas, the time is gone.  *Ahem* I will say though that it was not a regret to spend an evening nestled within the embrace of this establishment.  It is what some may refer to as ""high end.""  The sleek/sophisticated modern presentation is impressive, with a long tech/chic hallway with some cool dim/neon vibes lighting your way into the main vestibule.  Also included are some Asian inspired aesthetics (as this is a ""Chinese"" restaurant... despite the fact that the name sounds more Japanese, if anything else).  The NYC iteration of Hakkasan is more about the food compared to the Las Vegas version (which is more about the nightlife and the high profile DJs and the girls in the slinky dresses...).  The fare of the night will be of the Chinese variety, all expertly crafted, impeccably presented, and just tasty enough (the food tastes good, but it won't change your life... but I'm giving points to presentation, since we do ""eat"" with our eyes almost as much). After discussing the place with some Chinese friends of mine, they scoffed at the idea of turning a number of Chinese dishes into fine dining.

The sweetness was perfectly balanced out by the light touch of sourness from the yuzu soup, well done!I could not believe that this was my first visit to Hakkasan NY (well I've been to its SanFran location). Guess now I have a new to-go spot in the city! Best Chinese food hands down. The large, heavy steel door of the entrance at Hakkasan lead to a whole new world of high quality Chinese food and service experience. I've always wanted to check this place out after hearing many things about it from friends, but didn't have a nice enough occasion to, and when it was my birthday, I finally had a good reason to come! Immediately upon entering, I was greeted by two friendly hostesses who lead me to my table. The restaurant has such interesting decor with dim, blue lights and chinese-inspired panels that sections off the booths and dining areas in the restaurant.In terms of what we ordered, we started off with louis roederer champagne, and ordered the steamed dimsum platter for our appetizer, and pipa duck, honey glazed sea bass, and spicy seafood fried rice for our entrees. The dim sum platter came with 4 different kinds of dim sum, all steamed to perfection.  All the different pieces were not only so pretty to look at, but also so flavorful and unique in flavor. My favorite was the har gow (white dumpling with shrimp). Next came the entrees which were all quite heavy but flavorful orders. The duck was cooked and fried(?) so well and if you wrap it in half of the flour shells with some cucumber and scallion and sauce, it's the perfect duck wrap! The seabass dish was SO tender and almost melted in my mouth. The outside was crispy and sweet while the meat of the fish was more bland so really balanced out the sauce which could be overwhelming. Lastly, the spicy seafood fried rice gave extra variety to our meal and was also very good filled with lots of seafood. We also received a plate of steamed greens which were surprisingly very delicious and paired perfectly with the heavy dishes. Sipping on champagne throughout the meal also helped keep the palate clean and not leave a greasy after taste.Since it was my birthday, the staff so wonderfully prepared dessert for me, and I got to try the yuzu desert. Not only was it so pretty to look at with the pretty spring shades of yellow and purple, but also delicious - citrus-y and very bright!I was overall very pleased with my experience at Hakkasan with the lovely waiters so attentive to my needs. I will say that they were a bit clumsy with handling the dishes and placing them on the table, but I was really excited about the food that it didn't bother me too much. I couldn't have asked for a better birthday night spent and I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who is seeking high quality Chinese dining experience for a special occasion, a place to take their parents or other important guests, or just to try something new! Stick to the small plates- Dim sum dumplings platter was a home run, duck salad was dope. Cocktails are exceptional. Read a review calling this ""Ruby Foos for the ultra-wealthy."" So they lost their Michelin star- who cares? This is not High-end so much as it is club/loungey- hence the vegas location. I defy anyone to say the food isnt beautiful and delicious. Snobs gonna hate. The food here is fantastic. Cane here with a group  so we were able to try a bunch of things, all of which were good.Food: Here is some dishes that stood out to me: the shrimp dim sum, the Seabass (still can't stop thinking about it), the salt and pepper fake chicken (best fake meat I've ever had in my life, also can't stop thinking about it), the chocolate and sesame dumplings (I've been on the hunt for chocolate dumplings ever since I won't be satisfied until I go back for more).Drinks: I have Prosecco which was great, but there's this drink here which is a smoky Grand Marnier drink, and it comes with actual smoke :-) get it.Service: Everyone was friendly, but service at our table was slow. We were with a large group so that's understandable, however, I realized that if I didn't order a drink at the time I receive my last drink, it would be a long time before I'd get a new one. So that's the approach bastard, re-ordering as soon as items came out. This is one of those fancy place like Tao. A great place to impress your date, great food and terrific service.Note to restaurant if you are reading this, please educate your staff about hoisin sauce, it does NOT contain any seafood at all. I didn't want to embarrass the waiter but he told us the hoisin sauce contains shellfish (my fiance is allergic). I don't blame him, the restaurant probably told him so. On to the food. We had the Pan-seared vegetable Shanghai dumpling, they made them very tasty even though it's just vegatables! I had the XO Wok-fry duck breast. I have to compliment the texture of the duck, it almost feel like they were beef, I love it. And the sauce was great I poured them over the fried rice we ordered. My fiance had the Mongolian style beef rib-eye. The apple and mushroom was a great side for this dish. The sauce was fantastic.We do not drink alcohol so we ordered the Virgin Hakka. Not having a sweet tooth myself, it was way too sweet for me.This is one of those people-watching restaurant, the guys at the other table keep looking at me. Piece of advice, if you are going with your date, pay attention to her! Amazing place, everything we ate and drank here was on point, along with the ambience and presentation! Worth every penny, though it was a pretty pricetag! We started with the steamed Vegetarian Dim Sum platter, then had the Vegetarian Imitation Chicken with StirFry & Brown Rice, and completed our meal with the chocolate ganache dessert, decorated with popped kernels! Very picturesque! In terms of drinks, We had the Temple of Heaven, and the Hakka signature drink which my husband still raves about! Posted some pics! Check it out! Can't wait to go back! Came here for just a drink with my friend before going to see a show. Space: very trendy. The bar lounge is huge. Probably one of the longest bars I've seen so far. They also have large full tables by the bar(which is not the main dining). I didn't get to check out the main dining space, but peeped through from the bar seat and it seemed very nice and classy. Dimly lit in there. Service: You're first greeted by the host staff. Seems very friendly. Bathroom attendant as well. Bartender is friendly and gave nice recommendations. So are the bar back staff. Everyone we came in contact with was very friendly and attentive. Excellent service. Menu: I posted the menu so everyone can have a look at what they offer. It seems very tasty. The menu had a couple more pages, but they were tasting menus. So I didn't bother posting it. Good for: dates, group gatherings, anyone who's looking for a trendy kind of fine dining in Midtown West/Hell's Kitchen area. I'd say this is a rare find in the area. Kind of feels like you stepped into the Meatpacking District. I'll def. be back for a full dining experience soon to have the dining experience. :) The dim sum awesome the ambience awesome the price over the top. This slick world wide chain restaurant delivers the goods but at a very steep price and is no surprise considering one of their establishments is located in Dubai.  Food delivery however, o-so-slow. Good fit for the west side of Manhattan and seems to pack in the tourists from Times square. Not so sure they would do as well if located in other areas of the city.  Bottom line: probably worth the price of admission once anyway to check out their dining experience and digs. Tip: go for the Hakk steamed dim sum. The food is good! Probably the best Asian fushion place I have been to. I definitely think I can say sth about Chinese food or Asian food in general. This place doesn't disappoint. All the dishes are to the point and placed gracefully in the most trending place. The dim sum platter is a must. I got tofu mushroom something, also good. It comes with egg fried rice and Bok Choy. The dessert is mango pudding, also fresh and not overly sweet. Btw I did restaurant menu, for $42, they are pretty good. Because you know most of the time, it's just a trap for restaurant week menu. Here, you can find all the dishes from their original menu and at lower price.(tasting good 70+ for similar stuff). Anyway, highly recommend. This is one fancy place with prices to match. But no worries, the food is amazing. The atmosphere is modern, sophisticated and contemporary; service is excellent, worthy of a fancy high end restaurant. The entrance is easy to miss but once in you will be wowed by nightclub like interiors.I got a virgin Hakka which was on the sweeter side, just how I like! We got the fried quail which came with rice pancakes;crispy shrimp dumpling was good too. For main course we got the vegetarian chicken with black pepper sauce (interesting concept) which tasted like chicken! The spicy prawns didn't look that great but was the best dish of the day. We ordered veg fried rice and noodles on the side as well. Chicken clay pot was flavorful too.The portion size is average.The desserts were lemon tart and salted caramel mousse. Yummy!This is a great place if you can get over the pricing. It's one to tick off the list. We had to wait for 45 minutes for a table which we had reserved but restaurant staff were very good and made it up with free cocktails. Food is amazing but pricey, service is excellent, and lady waitress was so professional and had great advice on dishes. I can see why this is so popular but you pay for it! This resturant was referred to me by my American Express travel agent and I had an opportunity to dine there recently. I am frequently in the mood for great Asian cuisine and Hakkasan did not disappoint. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the quality of the food. I experienced some really unique flavors too. The Sea Bass, which looked like a piece of Tuna when it came out, had a wonderful sweet caramelized glaze with what looked and tasted like a sear finish. While this is not how you would normally expect Sea Bass, one bite and it was clear why this is their #1 dish. The Prawns were equally tasty and were served in a unique spicy curry sauce. I was most impressed however, with their Duck! I was saving this dish for last when all of the dishes came to my table, because I love duck and have had it served in just about every way.  When my waiter saw that I had not tasted it 5 minutes into my meal she urged me to begin eating this dish before it got cold and after one bite I could easily see why. Simply WOW!  Words cannot express the overall flavorful explosion from this dish. This Duck was served in thin small one-inch pieces spread out on a plate in a rich sweet and savory brown sauce.  The meat was perfectly moist.  The skin was crackling crispy. And both parts together with that sauce was sinful. I have never tasted Duck so good in my life and this dish was so memorable, that I can't wait until I am back in The City to try it again. Service was good, not great, and for this reason I am giving a 4 star over 5. What a meal! Hubby gave me a surprise and took met here for anniversary. We didn't realize it was restaurant week. Dinner 3 course for NY restaurant week is $49 which is a great deal for this place as most dishes are around $30-40 each. One of the dishes was $228! It had caviar I think. We tried Sanpie chicken, Spicy Prawn, dim sum platter and for desserts we had sago pudding and choc/caramel special that they had on the menu(I've forgotten the name). The prawn and chicken are both high in salt and I would recommend that getting with plain rice rather than fried rice that we ordered. Having said that, the egg fried rice were absolutely delicious. Prawn is definitely recommended, the gravy was really good. Sago pudding was light and yummy. The ambience was good but we went on Monday and because of restaurant week, it was full house and very noisy. Decor is very nice. Their kitchen is the biggest I've ever seen and they have separate chefs for diff cuisines. The manager there took me for a little tour of kitchen just from outside and she told me all this. It is quite pricey though so I won't go back there unless there was a special deal on. My bougie Chinese family is all about Hakkasan. From its trendy interior to its savory dishes and sublime service, I would definitely recommend a visit. Table favorites: Crispy duck salad, Jasmine tea smoked pork ribs, Hakka pork belly claypot, Tofu aubergine and shiitake mushroom claypotHonorary mentions: Hakka steamed dim sum platter, Fried soft shell crab with curry leaf and chili Drinks: I am a fan of gin - enjoyed both the body of the Smoky Negroni, as well as the bite of the Shiso GimletDessert: loved the Pomegranate & Chocolate Bombe and the Black sesame and chocolate dumplings Enjoy! Being a Chinese myself already set a high bar for Chinese food. Hakkasan solidly surpassed my expectation.Many good drink choices on the menu. The dim sum platters (both vegetarian and regular one) are must-tries! Very delicate in presentation with high quality delicious materials. The giant prawn in spicy curry sauce is another highlight (the spicy curry sauce has a nice kick). Other dishes like Peking duck, lamb appetizer, and black cod are solid too. Lastly, the desserts are unforgettable! I absolutely enjoyed both the chocolate dumplings and the carrot cake!! Just take a look at my photos - Amazingly delicate presentation, flavorful yet not too sweet. The winter-slurry that came about on this fateful night could not stop us from our rendezvous.  Sadly, this would be the penultimate opportunity to see her until she'd be spirited away to lands on the other side of the world.  Regret permeates the memories of the time I spent here... to have the ability to go back and kick my past self in the balls, I salivate at that opportunity; alas, the time is gone.  *Ahem* I will say though that it was not a regret to spend an evening nestled within the embrace of this establishment.  It is what some may refer to as ""high end.""  The sleek/sophisticated modern presentation is impressive, with a long tech/chic hallway with some cool dim/neon vibes lighting your way into the main vestibule.  Also included are some Asian inspired aesthetics (as this is a ""Chinese"" restaurant... despite the fact that the name sounds more Japanese, if anything else).  The NYC iteration of Hakkasan is more about the food compared to the Las Vegas version (which is more about the nightlife and the high profile DJs and the girls in the slinky dresses...).  The fare of the night will be of the Chinese variety, all expertly crafted, impeccably presented, and just tasty enough (the food tastes good, but it won't change your life... but I'm giving points to presentation, since we do ""eat"" with our eyes almost as much). After discussing the place with some Chinese friends of mine, they scoffed at the idea of turning a number of Chinese dishes into fine dining.  I will say that I ate some of the prettiest steamed and fried dim sum dishes at this place, but at the end of the day they tasted like the stuff I'd get off a cart in Chinatown... it makes sense since they are using the same ingredients (maybe of a higher quality, and by the hands of experts, but in the end all the same).  Nevertheless, if you have the money to burn, whether you just ball that way, or if you're looking to experience the place for yourself to prove me wrong, or if you mistake it for a nightclub and then end up eating there anyway, or if you're trying to impress a person with lady parts... then you could certainly do worse than this place. Inches away from my home, Hakkasan is one of the two Chinese places that I always found myself enjoying every single dish out of it (the other one being Buddakan). Lost its Michelin star last year, Hakkasan nevertheless continued to impress me from both its inside decoration and food quality.We decided to kick off with the most renown steamed dim sum platter. Instead of focusing only on the taste (like all those ordinary Chinatown spots), Hakkasan did a really good job balancing out the color inside the platter - best presentation award! The fried prawn with foie gras carefully filled in and sesame covering its crust, was tender from the inside while crispy on the outside. Pork belly was the one that indeed impressed us - not at all greasy yet preserved its nature of softness, with just the right amount of scallions and garlic to bring out the flavor. Dessert was probably one of the best things you could enjoy at Hakkasan, if not the only one. We shared the chocolate dumpling with yuzu sauce pouring inside, serving as the broth.

The seabass dish was SO tender and almost melted in my mouth. The outside was crispy and sweet while the meat of the fish was more bland so really balanced out the sauce which could be overwhelming. Lastly, the spicy seafood fried rice gave extra variety to our meal and was also very good filled with lots of seafood. We also received a plate of steamed greens which were surprisingly very delicious and paired perfectly with the heavy dishes. Sipping on champagne throughout the meal also helped keep the palate clean and not leave a greasy after taste.Since it was my birthday, the staff so wonderfully prepared dessert for me, and I got to try the yuzu desert. Not only was it so pretty to look at with the pretty spring shades of yellow and purple, but also delicious - citrus-y and very bright!I was overall very pleased with my experience at Hakkasan with the lovely waiters so attentive to my needs. I will say that they were a bit clumsy with handling the dishes and placing them on the table, but I was really excited about the food that it didn't bother me too much. I couldn't have asked for a better birthday night spent and I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who is seeking high quality Chinese dining experience for a special occasion, a place to take their parents or other important guests, or just to try something new! Stick to the small plates- Dim sum dumplings platter was a home run, duck salad was dope. Cocktails are exceptional. Read a review calling this ""Ruby Foos for the ultra-wealthy."" So they lost their Michelin star- who cares? This is not High-end so much as it is club/loungey- hence the vegas location. I defy anyone to say the food isnt beautiful and delicious. Snobs gonna hate. The food here is fantastic. Cane here with a group  so we were able to try a bunch of things, all of which were good.Food: Here is some dishes that stood out to me: the shrimp dim sum, the Seabass (still can't stop thinking about it), the salt and pepper fake chicken (best fake meat I've ever had in my life, also can't stop thinking about it), the chocolate and sesame dumplings (I've been on the hunt for chocolate dumplings ever since I won't be satisfied until I go back for more).Drinks: I have Prosecco which was great, but there's this drink here which is a smoky Grand Marnier drink, and it comes with actual smoke :-) get it.Service: Everyone was friendly, but service at our table was slow. We were with a large group so that's understandable, however, I realized that if I didn't order a drink at the time I receive my last drink, it would be a long time before I'd get a new one. So that's the approach bastard, re-ordering as soon as items came out. This is one of those fancy place like Tao. A great place to impress your date, great food and terrific service.Note to restaurant if you are reading this, please educate your staff about hoisin sauce, it does NOT contain any seafood at all. I didn't want to embarrass the waiter but he told us the hoisin sauce contains shellfish (my fiance is allergic). I don't blame him, the restaurant probably told him so. On to the food. We had the Pan-seared vegetable Shanghai dumpling, they made them very tasty even though it's just vegatables! I had the XO Wok-fry duck breast. I have to compliment the texture of the duck, it almost feel like they were beef, I love it. And the sauce was great I poured them over the fried rice we ordered. My fiance had the Mongolian style beef rib-eye. The apple and mushroom was a great side for this dish. The sauce was fantastic.We do not drink alcohol so we ordered the Virgin Hakka. Not having a sweet tooth myself, it was way too sweet for me.This is one of those people-watching restaurant, the guys at the other table keep looking at me. Piece of advice, if you are going with your date, pay attention to her! Amazing place, everything we ate and drank here was on point, along with the ambience and presentation! Worth every penny, though it was a pretty pricetag! We started with the steamed Vegetarian Dim Sum platter, then had the Vegetarian Imitation Chicken with StirFry & Brown Rice, and completed our meal with the chocolate ganache dessert, decorated with popped kernels! Very picturesque! In terms of drinks, We had the Temple of Heaven, and the Hakka signature drink which my husband still raves about! Posted some pics! Check it out! Can't wait to go back! Came here for just a drink with my friend before going to see a show. Space: very trendy. The bar lounge is huge. Probably one of the longest bars I've seen so far. They also have large full tables by the bar(which is not the main dining). I didn't get to check out the main dining space, but peeped through from the bar seat and it seemed very nice and classy. Dimly lit in there. Service: You're first greeted by the host staff. Seems very friendly. Bathroom attendant as well. Bartender is friendly and gave nice recommendations. So are the bar back staff. Everyone we came in contact with was very friendly and attentive. Excellent service. Menu: I posted the menu so everyone can have a look at what they offer. It seems very tasty. The menu had a couple more pages, but they were tasting menus. So I didn't bother posting it. Good for: dates, group gatherings, anyone who's looking for a trendy kind of fine dining in Midtown West/Hell's Kitchen area. I'd say this is a rare find in the area. Kind of feels like you stepped into the Meatpacking District. I'll def. be back for a full dining experience soon to have the dining experience. :) The dim sum awesome the ambience awesome the price over the top. This slick world wide chain restaurant delivers the goods but at a very steep price and is no surprise considering one of their establishments is located in Dubai.  Food delivery however, o-so-slow. Good fit for the west side of Manhattan and seems to pack in the tourists from Times square. Not so sure they would do as well if located in other areas of the city.  Bottom line: probably worth the price of admission once anyway to check out their dining experience and digs. Tip: go for the Hakk steamed dim sum. The food is good! Probably the best Asian fushion place I have been to. I definitely think I can say sth about Chinese food or Asian food in general. This place doesn't disappoint. All the dishes are to the point and placed gracefully in the most trending place. The dim sum platter is a must. I got tofu mushroom something, also good. It comes with egg fried rice and Bok Choy. The dessert is mango pudding, also fresh and not overly sweet. Btw I did restaurant menu, for $42, they are pretty good. Because you know most of the time, it's just a trap for restaurant week menu. Here, you can find all the dishes from their original menu and at lower price.(tasting good 70+ for similar stuff). Anyway, highly recommend. This is one fancy place with prices to match. But no worries, the food is amazing. The atmosphere is modern, sophisticated and contemporary; service is excellent, worthy of a fancy high end restaurant. The entrance is easy to miss but once in you will be wowed by nightclub like interiors.I got a virgin Hakka which was on the sweeter side, just how I like! We got the fried quail which came with rice pancakes;crispy shrimp dumpling was good too. For main course we got the vegetarian chicken with black pepper sauce (interesting concept) which tasted like chicken! The spicy prawns didn't look that great but was the best dish of the day. We ordered veg fried rice and noodles on the side as well. Chicken clay pot was flavorful too.The portion size is average.The desserts were lemon tart and salted caramel mousse. Yummy!This is a great place if you can get over the pricing. It's one to tick off the list. We had to wait for 45 minutes for a table which we had reserved but restaurant staff were very good and made it up with free cocktails. Food is amazing but pricey, service is excellent, and lady waitress was so professional and had great advice on dishes. I can see why this is so popular but you pay for it! This resturant was referred to me by my American Express travel agent and I had an opportunity to dine there recently. I am frequently in the mood for great Asian cuisine and Hakkasan did not disappoint. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the quality of the food. I experienced some really unique flavors too. The Sea Bass, which looked like a piece of Tuna when it came out, had a wonderful sweet caramelized glaze with what looked and tasted like a sear finish. While this is not how you would normally expect Sea Bass, one bite and it was clear why this is their #1 dish. The Prawns were equally tasty and were served in a unique spicy curry sauce. I was most impressed however, with their Duck! I was saving this dish for last when all of the dishes came to my table, because I love duck and have had it served in just about every way.  When my waiter saw that I had not tasted it 5 minutes into my meal she urged me to begin eating this dish before it got cold and after one bite I could easily see why. Simply WOW!  Words cannot express the overall flavorful explosion from this dish. This Duck was served in thin small one-inch pieces spread out on a plate in a rich sweet and savory brown sauce.  The meat was perfectly moist.  The skin was crackling crispy. And both parts together with that sauce was sinful. I have never tasted Duck so good in my life and this dish was so memorable, that I can't wait until I am back in The City to try it again. Service was good, not great, and for this reason I am giving a 4 star over 5. What a meal! Hubby gave me a surprise and took met here for anniversary. We didn't realize it was restaurant week. Dinner 3 course for NY restaurant week is $49 which is a great deal for this place as most dishes are around $30-40 each. One of the dishes was $228! It had caviar I think. We tried Sanpie chicken, Spicy Prawn, dim sum platter and for desserts we had sago pudding and choc/caramel special that they had on the menu(I've forgotten the name). The prawn and chicken are both high in salt and I would recommend that getting with plain rice rather than fried rice that we ordered. Having said that, the egg fried rice were absolutely delicious. Prawn is definitely recommended, the gravy was really good. Sago pudding was light and yummy. The ambience was good but we went on Monday and because of restaurant week, it was full house and very noisy. Decor is very nice. Their kitchen is the biggest I've ever seen and they have separate chefs for diff cuisines. The manager there took me for a little tour of kitchen just from outside and she told me all this. It is quite pricey though so I won't go back there unless there was a special deal on. My bougie Chinese family is all about Hakkasan. From its trendy interior to its savory dishes and sublime service, I would definitely recommend a visit. Table favorites: Crispy duck salad, Jasmine tea smoked pork ribs, Hakka pork belly claypot, Tofu aubergine and shiitake mushroom claypotHonorary mentions: Hakka steamed dim sum platter, Fried soft shell crab with curry leaf and chili Drinks: I am a fan of gin - enjoyed both the body of the Smoky Negroni, as well as the bite of the Shiso GimletDessert: loved the Pomegranate & Chocolate Bombe and the Black sesame and chocolate dumplings Enjoy! Being a Chinese myself already set a high bar for Chinese food. Hakkasan solidly surpassed my expectation.Many good drink choices on the menu. The dim sum platters (both vegetarian and regular one) are must-tries! Very delicate in presentation with high quality delicious materials. The giant prawn in spicy curry sauce is another highlight (the spicy curry sauce has a nice kick). Other dishes like Peking duck, lamb appetizer, and black cod are solid too. Lastly, the desserts are unforgettable! I absolutely enjoyed both the chocolate dumplings and the carrot cake!! Just take a look at my photos - Amazingly delicate presentation, flavorful yet not too sweet. The winter-slurry that came about on this fateful night could not stop us from our rendezvous.  Sadly, this would be the penultimate opportunity to see her until she'd be spirited away to lands on the other side of the world.  Regret permeates the memories of the time I spent here... to have the ability to go back and kick my past self in the balls, I salivate at that opportunity; alas, the time is gone.  *Ahem* I will say though that it was not a regret to spend an evening nestled within the embrace of this establishment.  It is what some may refer to as ""high end.""  The sleek/sophisticated modern presentation is impressive, with a long tech/chic hallway with some cool dim/neon vibes lighting your way into the main vestibule.  Also included are some Asian inspired aesthetics (as this is a ""Chinese"" restaurant... despite the fact that the name sounds more Japanese, if anything else).  The NYC iteration of Hakkasan is more about the food compared to the Las Vegas version (which is more about the nightlife and the high profile DJs and the girls in the slinky dresses...).  The fare of the night will be of the Chinese variety, all expertly crafted, impeccably presented, and just tasty enough (the food tastes good, but it won't change your life... but I'm giving points to presentation, since we do ""eat"" with our eyes almost as much). After discussing the place with some Chinese friends of mine, they scoffed at the idea of turning a number of Chinese dishes into fine dining.  I will say that I ate some of the prettiest steamed and fried dim sum dishes at this place, but at the end of the day they tasted like the stuff I'd get off a cart in Chinatown... it makes sense since they are using the same ingredients (maybe of a higher quality, and by the hands of experts, but in the end all the same).  Nevertheless, if you have the money to burn, whether you just ball that way, or if you're looking to experience the place for yourself to prove me wrong, or if you mistake it for a nightclub and then end up eating there anyway, or if you're trying to impress a person with lady parts... then you could certainly do worse than this place. Inches away from my home, Hakkasan is one of the two Chinese places that I always found myself enjoying every single dish out of it (the other one being Buddakan). Lost its Michelin star last year, Hakkasan nevertheless continued to impress me from both its inside decoration and food quality.We decided to kick off with the most renown steamed dim sum platter. Instead of focusing only on the taste (like all those ordinary Chinatown spots), Hakkasan did a really good job balancing out the color inside the platter - best presentation award! The fried prawn with foie gras carefully filled in and sesame covering its crust, was tender from the inside while crispy on the outside. Pork belly was the one that indeed impressed us - not at all greasy yet preserved its nature of softness, with just the right amount of scallions and garlic to bring out the flavor. Dessert was probably one of the best things you could enjoy at Hakkasan, if not the only one. We shared the chocolate dumpling with yuzu sauce pouring inside, serving as the broth. The sweetness was perfectly balanced out by the light touch of sourness from the yuzu soup, well done!I could not believe that this was my first visit to Hakkasan NY (well I've been to its SanFran location). Guess now I have a new to-go spot in the city! Best Chinese food hands down. The large, heavy steel door of the entrance at Hakkasan lead to a whole new world of high quality Chinese food and service experience. I've always wanted to check this place out after hearing many things about it from friends, but didn't have a nice enough occasion to, and when it was my birthday, I finally had a good reason to come! Immediately upon entering, I was greeted by two friendly hostesses who lead me to my table. The restaurant has such interesting decor with dim, blue lights and chinese-inspired panels that sections off the booths and dining areas in the restaurant.In terms of what we ordered, we started off with louis roederer champagne, and ordered the steamed dimsum platter for our appetizer, and pipa duck, honey glazed sea bass, and spicy seafood fried rice for our entrees. The dim sum platter came with 4 different kinds of dim sum, all steamed to perfection.  All the different pieces were not only so pretty to look at, but also so flavorful and unique in flavor. My favorite was the har gow (white dumpling with shrimp). Next came the entrees which were all quite heavy but flavorful orders. The duck was cooked and fried(?) so well and if you wrap it in half of the flour shells with some cucumber and scallion and sauce, it's the perfect duck wrap!

Secondly, the service cannot be rated as Michelin level. The environment is too loud and the sever for our table was  hanging around with other tables.However, the dishes and drinks here are inevitably delicious. We had stir-fried ribeye, lamb, duck and the crispy cod. The beef and lamb meat melt right into the mouth. Moreover, the duck meat comes with slices fat and slices of skin on the surface which improve the nature palatable taste of duck meat. For the drink, I tried Smoky Negroni and Green Destiny. Smoky Negroni is a special drink, because it is made with Grand Marnier smoke infusion which is creative but not palatable, but green destiny has woodsy taste and comes with kiwi crush inside. I personally recommend this drink.Anyway, I give this restaurant a rate of 3* and a half. Came here second time with another friend, ordered restaurant week menu, waited at least 30 minutes for EACH course..... people came after us finished their meal when we just finished half, because of the unreasonably long waiting time.POS machine went down, took us another 30 minutes to get the bill and make payment. And in the end they overcharged my credit card by doubling the amount I should pay................ already filed a dispute with the credit card company and hope to get my money back.Won't come back again. Fancy place for Chinese food in the city. Food and service was okay. Me and friends came by for dinner during restaurant week. The entrance is definitely easy to miss but you'll see some bouncers standing outside. My friends got there early but i got there a little late and we had to wait for a table because of that.Anyways we were led to our table and they took our orders. Got the  sanpei chicken claypot which was really good. My friends got the spicy shrimp and lamb tenderloin, not as impressive as the chicken claypot. Got fried dumplings for appetizers which were okay and got the coconut and mango sago pudding which was okay as well. Overall, the price tag is high but it is an experience of sorts i guess. You dress to impress here. The music wasn't that loud when we were there. Just felt like there was something lacking (not sure if it was the service or something else) and felt like we had dinner in a modern night club.  A-Ok would prretty much describe my experience. Dined at Hakkasan during Restaurant Week and was glad to see signature dishes available on the RW menu. Started off with the Hakka steamed dim sum platter (Har gau, prawn and Chinese chive dumpling, black pepper duck dumpling). Three sauces accompanied them chili in oil (spicy), another red sauce (creamy texture, mild), soy sauce). All 3 pieces, which were creatively prepared were hearty and actually really good. A lot of flavor was packed into each bite. I did use the sauces too which enhanced the taste. For my main I had Spicy prawns with lily bulb and almond. It came atop a yellow curry paste. All entrees are served with the option of steamed jasmine rice or egg fried rice and plain or garlic bok choy. I ordered the egg fried rice and garlic bok choy. The prawns definitely needed rice to enjoy the curry and again it was really good. I had a taste of my friend's Wok-fried lamb tenderloin in chili bean sauce, onions and peppers and it was juicy and tasty. That dish is great on its own if you're a meat eater - don't really need rice if you want to avoid.For dessert I opted for the Caramel cremeux, Earl Grey & chocolate gelato. I didn't like it. The caramel had a strange, herbal taste which for this dessert combination didn't go well. The gelato was average tasting - texture seemed a little too liquid for gelato. Hakkasan is a dimly-lit sexy dining scene that offers Asian fusion dishes that have potential. It's worth a visit and is a nice destination for the area.

Dined at Hakkasan during Restaurant Week and was glad to see signature dishes available on the RW menu. Started off with the Hakka steamed dim sum platter (Har gau, prawn and Chinese chive dumpling, black pepper duck dumpling). Three sauces accompanied them chili in oil (spicy), another red sauce (creamy texture, mild), soy sauce). All 3 pieces, which were creatively prepared were hearty and actually really good. A lot of flavor was packed into each bite. I did use the sauces too which enhanced the taste. For my main I had Spicy prawns with lily bulb and almond. It came atop a yellow curry paste. All entrees are served with the option of steamed jasmine rice or egg fried rice and plain or garlic bok choy. I ordered the egg fried rice and garlic bok choy. The prawns definitely needed rice to enjoy the curry and again it was really good. I had a taste of my friend's Wok-fried lamb tenderloin in chili bean sauce, onions and peppers and it was juicy and tasty. That dish is great on its own if you're a meat eater - don't really need rice if you want to avoid.For dessert I opted for the Caramel cremeux, Earl Grey & chocolate gelato. I didn't like it. The caramel had a strange, herbal taste which for this dessert combination didn't go well. The gelato was average tasting - texture seemed a little too liquid for gelato. Hakkasan is a dimly-lit sexy dining scene that offers Asian fusion dishes that have potential. It's worth a visit and is a nice destination for the area. First of all, this restaurant is defined as a high end Asian restaurant, so stop playing the annoying and loud music. Secondly, the service cannot be rated as Michelin level. The environment is too loud and the sever for our table was  hanging around with other tables.However, the dishes and drinks here are inevitably delicious. We had stir-fried ribeye, lamb, duck and the crispy cod. The beef and lamb meat melt right into the mouth. Moreover, the duck meat comes with slices fat and slices of skin on the surface which improve the nature palatable taste of duck meat. For the drink, I tried Smoky Negroni and Green Destiny. Smoky Negroni is a special drink, because it is made with Grand Marnier smoke infusion which is creative but not palatable, but green destiny has woodsy taste and comes with kiwi crush inside. I personally recommend this drink.Anyway, I give this restaurant a rate of 3* and a half. Came here second time with another friend, ordered restaurant week menu, waited at least 30 minutes for EACH course..... people came after us finished their meal when we just finished half, because of the unreasonably long waiting time.POS machine went down, took us another 30 minutes to get the bill and make payment. And in the end they overcharged my credit card by doubling the amount I should pay................ already filed a dispute with the credit card company and hope to get my money back.Won't come back again. Fancy place for Chinese food in the city. Food and service was okay. Me and friends came by for dinner during restaurant week. The entrance is definitely easy to miss but you'll see some bouncers standing outside. My friends got there early but i got there a little late and we had to wait for a table because of that.Anyways we were led to our table and they took our orders. Got the  sanpei chicken claypot which was really good. My friends got the spicy shrimp and lamb tenderloin, not as impressive as the chicken claypot. Got fried dumplings for appetizers which were okay and got the coconut and mango sago pudding which was okay as well. Overall, the price tag is high but it is an experience of sorts i guess.

Three sauces accompanied them chili in oil (spicy), another red sauce (creamy texture, mild), soy sauce). All 3 pieces, which were creatively prepared were hearty and actually really good. A lot of flavor was packed into each bite. I did use the sauces too which enhanced the taste. For my main I had Spicy prawns with lily bulb and almond. It came atop a yellow curry paste. All entrees are served with the option of steamed jasmine rice or egg fried rice and plain or garlic bok choy. I ordered the egg fried rice and garlic bok choy. The prawns definitely needed rice to enjoy the curry and again it was really good. I had a taste of my friend's Wok-fried lamb tenderloin in chili bean sauce, onions and peppers and it was juicy and tasty. That dish is great on its own if you're a meat eater - don't really need rice if you want to avoid.For dessert I opted for the Caramel cremeux, Earl Grey & chocolate gelato. I didn't like it. The caramel had a strange, herbal taste which for this dessert combination didn't go well. The gelato was average tasting - texture seemed a little too liquid for gelato. Hakkasan is a dimly-lit sexy dining scene that offers Asian fusion dishes that have potential. It's worth a visit and is a nice destination for the area. First of all, this restaurant is defined as a high end Asian restaurant, so stop playing the annoying and loud music. Secondly, the service cannot be rated as Michelin level. The environment is too loud and the sever for our table was  hanging around with other tables.However, the dishes and drinks here are inevitably delicious. We had stir-fried ribeye, lamb, duck and the crispy cod. The beef and lamb meat melt right into the mouth. Moreover, the duck meat comes with slices fat and slices of skin on the surface which improve the nature palatable taste of duck meat. For the drink, I tried Smoky Negroni and Green Destiny. Smoky Negroni is a special drink, because it is made with Grand Marnier smoke infusion which is creative but not palatable, but green destiny has woodsy taste and comes with kiwi crush inside. I personally recommend this drink.Anyway, I give this restaurant a rate of 3* and a half. Came here second time with another friend, ordered restaurant week menu, waited at least 30 minutes for EACH course..... people came after us finished their meal when we just finished half, because of the unreasonably long waiting time.POS machine went down, took us another 30 minutes to get the bill and make payment. And in the end they overcharged my credit card by doubling the amount I should pay................ already filed a dispute with the credit card company and hope to get my money back.Won't come back again. Fancy place for Chinese food in the city. Food and service was okay. Me and friends came by for dinner during restaurant week. The entrance is definitely easy to miss but you'll see some bouncers standing outside. My friends got there early but i got there a little late and we had to wait for a table because of that.Anyways we were led to our table and they took our orders. Got the  sanpei chicken claypot which was really good. My friends got the spicy shrimp and lamb tenderloin, not as impressive as the chicken claypot. Got fried dumplings for appetizers which were okay and got the coconut and mango sago pudding which was okay as well. Overall, the price tag is high but it is an experience of sorts i guess. You dress to impress here. The music wasn't that loud when we were there. Just felt like there was something lacking (not sure if it was the service or something else) and felt like we had dinner in a modern night club.  A-Ok would prretty much describe my experience.
