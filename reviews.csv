Needless to say, I've eaten at a lot of Indian restaurants... And I must say that Deccan Spice is amazing. I don't go to Jersey often, but when I do I will definitely be back. I found this place while looking for someplace for dinner on Yelp and I want disappointed. The menu has a lot of variety and everything I got was very tasty! I got the biryani and butter chicken which is my standard go to everywhere. The food was perfect, the spice level was great, and the price was very reasonable.

My favorite are the Gongura chicken, Naatu Kodi vepudu, Butter chicken and chicken pepper fry. The food can be spicy sometimes, so make sure you let them know you want your curry mild. The special chicken biryani is worth a mention too.Service - fast and prompt serviceAmbience - Not very appealing.

I do not know if the management has changed or the cooks. Neither the food nor the ambience has been the same. The last couple of times I came here they were renovating and had kept the door open since there was no A/C, it was boiling hot in there. Restroom is filthy and poorly maintained. This was just a general review. Now let me add my latest experience. I went in their with my family and ordered a chicken entree, which ideally comes with a side of rice but was not given to us. My parents ordered veg soup and asked them to make it spicy. It was bland hence we politely asked for some chili paste or chili sauce to which one of the servers says, sorry we don\'t have it. We were stunned as its nearly impossible for an indian restaurant not to have a side of hot/chili sauce. To top it up, she states that she can offer some ketchup instead. Whaaaat ??? Who adds ketchup to their soup ?? We said, can you please check with the chef about it, since we got it last time we were here, she replies ""No ! That might be ketchup"" We were like seriously ??? This did not stop. On asking , why were we not served the rice with our curry entree, we were told that since we have ordered naan separately (meaning, we are paying for it), they (deccan spice) thought that it wobt be needed. Wow!! So basically, the rice that is a part of our dish was cancelled upon thier own assumption and without even asking us. Yes !!!!! This actually happened. The story dosen\'t end here. We asked if we can have some pickle, reply "" we dont serve, pickle"". Can we have some side of yogurt, reply "" we dont have yogurt"". Guys, do you really wanna run this business or lock ut down. I so wished that , I could narrate this story to the owner of this restaurant because I feel pity for him spending so much but is still losing customers. I am not going back to this place. Good luck if you do !!!'"

We've tried other JC Indian spots that deliver to Newark and this is the best. We always get the chicken biryani, chicken kadai, butter chicken & naan; they're obvs our favorites. Their food is also quite spicy compared to most Indian restaurants I've been to, which I love. Tandoori chicken is usually too salty and I HATE how they sprinkle their samosas with this sour powder. Why?! The goat kadai didn't pass the test BUT I have never enjoyed goat eating out. Probably spoiled by the goat my bf and his mom makes. Don't forget to wash down your fiery meal with some delish mango lassi!LOVE that they have a coupon service where they text coupons based on order history.HATE the raitas & the $10 delivery charge to Newark.

They have recently revived their ambience and the place has more comfortable couches. I love their malai kofta which comes in a orange gravy - similar to butter chicken gravy. My fiance loves their malabar parantha which they make from scratch and a little tough to get right. Their much talked about biryani is pretty good if you talk about the chicken spiced in the marination. A little on the spicier end, so you would need a buttermilk to cool it down(which is good by the way). Service is decent, although they could do with a few mroe servers.

We asked if the Andhra chicken kurma had boneless chicken pieces in it while ordering our takeaway & the person at the counter asked someone in the kitchen and said yes. Turns out it wasn't and had large pieces of chicken on the bone. Most it was barely cooked. The Goat Dum Biryani is medium spiced and the quantity and quality, are both decent. On all three occasions it was fresh and came accompanied by 'mirchi ka salan' (capsicum curry). The Deccan Special Biryani which was essentially Chicken tikka biryani that we tried recently was terrible. Tiny tiny tikka pieces thrown into the rice, it was some kind of bad joke in the name of biryani. Almost inedible. The Bagara Baingan (eggplant in spicy curry) was good and definitely try it, if you're looking for a vegetarian option.

My stomach is starting to churn as I write this review and conjure up the memory of how the food was burning holes in my esophagus and tears welled up in my eyes at the intense spice level.  Yeah, it was THAT bad.  We ordered the Gobi Manchurian which are like small deep-fried (vegetable) balls for our shared appetizer, a vegetable biryani and the Veg Saag Subji.   It was really odd that the Veg Saag did not come with any rice nor naan so we had to place an actual order of that.  I mean, the dish is naturally mushy so how did they expect us to eat it without rice or naan?  The Vegetable Biryani was very so-so and did not do very much to quell my hungry state.  The space is extremely cramped as well; so much so that when the woman sat down next to me at the other table, she couldn\'t really get through and dragged the contents on our tablecloth and nearly caused multiple spills.

I just realized it yesterday when I went for lunch at Deccan Spice on Newark Ave. in Jersey City, NJ.First things first, the tables for two are super-tiny and plates and serving containers big so co-existence not possible if you order an appetizer and an entree. We had to use the empty table next to us along with our table. The water was hot tap water without any ice or straw. Isn't it supposed to be cold water during summer months or any other month for that matter?Also, just a strong word of caution, the meat that we ordered i.e. goat and chicken were uncooked and hard leading us to have an upset stomach later in the day despite of asking the server if the meat was fresh before placing the order.It almost took an eternity each time after we were seated to get the menu, take our order and actually bring the order.We ordered the Andhra Chilli Chicken for appetizer which was a mix of chicken pieces (incompletely cooked) with spices and garnished with green chillies, lime and onions.For the entree, we ordered 1. The garlic naan which was wafer thin instead of soft and fluffy.2. Goat Dum Biryani which had the rice mildly spiced and well cooked and tasted really good only to be spoiled by uncooked, tasteless Goat meat. (Paradise Biryani is way-way better.)3. Charminar ka Murgh which was supposed to be spicy, boneless chicken in spinach gravy turned out to be tasteless, uncooked chicken dish with green spinach paste with no salt or spices at all. We reported it to the manager who promptly offered to replace it. So, we ordered instead the Andhra Chicken Kurma, a spicy chicken speciality which  turned out to be a bland, faint Green paste with the same uncooked chicken. (I have eaten better Andhra chicken, please spare the agony.)We were really dejected and upset with our gastronomic experiment at Deccan Spice going horribly wrong, both in terms of quality of food and service. I will never visit this place again or recommend it to anyone."""

To put it more simply, this is the best proper restaurant on India Street in JC based on quality, authenticity and variety of Indian food, and that is saying a lot.

Every item was a treat to our taste buds and my friends were delighted at the food offered to us at 2 am. Biryani is authentic and super tasty. Paneer Masala, Gobi etc are awesome. The food was well prepared and tasted great, the ambiance was great and the staff were very accommodating. We finished all the dishes and by the time we finished our heavy dinner (or late dinner) to our suprise we are offered Qubani Ka Meetha and Lassi as complimentary. That was very sweet of those guys and we enjoyed the 90 mins dining experience very much. In the taste department, their Biryani lived up to the hype and the Paneer Masala was extraordinary.

Plus it does take a long time to get the food, but it used to be worth the wait.I'm disappointed with their service in the restaurant so had placed an online order, took a long time to deliver, plus the delivery guy was rude and forced an extra tip, i just wanted him out so gave it away, but that's the last of my money these people are ever getting.

Bad choice!The waiter appeared annoyed when my dad was taking an extra second to glance at the menu to make sure he ordered correctly. He didn\'t make eye contact and just generally seemed off-put by having to take orders. I understand you\'re not meant for this life kid, but you\'re working for someone for something, at least don\'t act like you\'re too good for the job you\'re being paid for. Very disappointing. I had to ask him to bring glasses half way through since he\'d forgotten to set the table when we walked in. We also asked for a fork THREE times and one never came. One of waiters even pointed to one on the table and said ""you have one there."" Are you kidding me? I didn\'t ask you if I had one sitting here, I\'m asking you to bring me another one. The food was not worth being treated like this. The tables were a little too small and one of them was a little wobbly. All in all, worst experience with waiters in a long time.

We had to wait till eternity and constantly remind the waiters to get our orders. Meanwhile we heard from other tables about thali being terrible and hence decided to cancel our order. But we had already waited for 45 mins and waiters said the thalis are ready. By this time we had already lost our apetite. Now lets move on to the actual food which is better left unspoken. Thalis as expected were terrible and cold - curries, pulao and rasam were very salty. Chapatis were burnt and we could hardly eat anything here. Even the gobi manchurian was totally burnt. My friend who rarely cooks joked that even he could make better curries. Forget the thali being ""unlimited"", we could not even finish the limited version of the thali and left most of it as it was inedible. Not sure why they took 45 mins as most of items were cold and stale. We went home and had the 2 minute noodles which tasted much better.

The tender chicken, great rice, accompanying sauces, and a perfect blend of spices creates one of a kind biryani down to the last bite.'"

Updated review","3.0 star rating","b""I decided to give them another try. I ordered Chicken curry, dal fry, Kadai paneer, Gobhi Manchurian and breads. This time the delivery took one hour which was much closer to my expectations. The food was better too. Dal Fry was perhaps the best dish. Chicken curry and paneer were good as well. The bread was the only thing I didn't like. I'll probably be ordering again from this place."""

I recently came here for dinner with a group of friends and was able to sample much of their extensive menu. EVERYTHING was delicious and full of flavor. My favorites were the chili shrimp (had the perfect amount of spicy kick), butter chicken with garlic naan, deccan spice special biryani (house specialty). The desserts... were out of this world! The gulab jamun (love the cardamon flavor) and double ka meetha (perfect combination of chewy and sweet goodness) were my absolute favorites. I'll definitely be back, which is convenient with the PATH (less than half an hour from Manhattan)."""
